<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">CATTLEMEN AND FARMERS READY FOR WAR.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fort Worth</span>, August 5, 18&mdash;. One hundred and
seventy-five thousand head of cattle are being slowly
drifted and driven from the drought-parched sections
of Northwestern Texas into Jacks County, along the
waters of the West Fork of Trinity. The herders who
accompany them demand that they must have grass
and water, or blood. The farmers, who will be greatly
damaged by the passage of these immense herds,
are arming and say the cattle shall not come in&mdash;that
they must be driven back at all hazards. To permit
them to pass means fences destroyed, crops ruined, and the
meagre supply of water exhausted; to turn them back
means death to the cattle and financial disaster to the
men who own them. To-day the news was carried from
house to house, and the farmers are turning out to a
man, resolved to rendezvous on Bear Creek and forbid<span class="pagenum">[2]</span>
the driving of the cattle through their lands. Large
squads have gone to the front, and they are well-armed
and desperate. Sheriff Reins will be on hand to-morrow,
and so will a company of militia under command of Captain
Fuller. Several conflicts, involving the loss of six
or seven lives, have already taken place between the
cattlemen and the farmers, the particulars of which have
not yet found publicity.</p></div>

<p>Of all the boys into whose hands this story
may fall, and who make it a point to read the
daily papers, I venture to say that not one in
a hundred will remember that he ever saw the
above despatch, which was flashed over the
wires one bright summer morning a few years
ago; but if those boys had been on the ground
as I was, and witnessed the thrilling and affecting
scenes that transpired before and after that
despatch was written, they would have seen
some things that time could never efface from
their memories.</p>

<p>If ever I saw suffering cattle or determined,
almost desperate, men, who were fairly spoiling
for a fight, it was on that sweltering August
day when a big brown-whiskered man, a
wealthy farmer of Jacks County, accompanied
by the sheriff and two deputies, rode<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
up to the wagon and demanded to see “the
boss.” Around the wagon were gathered a
weary and dusty party of men and boys,
who had come there to slake their thirst,
and John Chisholm, the man to whose enterprise
and push the great Texas cattle trade
owed its existence, was just raising a cup of
the precious fluid to his lips. I say “precious”
because our supply was limited, and
the nearest stream far away.</p>

<p>“It tastes as though it had been boiled for
a week,” said he, after he had moistened his
parched mouth, “but every drop of it is worth
its weight in gold. Touch it lightly, boys,
for there is no telling when we shall be able
to fill the cask again. Have any of the scouts
come in yet? If we don’t find a pool pretty
soon we shall all be ruined. Just see there!”
he added, waving his hand toward the back
trail. “A blind man could easily follow our
route, for every rod of it is marked with dead
beeves.”</p>

<p>It would have taken something besides a
“pool” of water to quench the thirst of that
multitude of cattle, which were drifting along<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
a mile or so in advance of the wagon, almost
concealed by the suffocating cloud of dust
that hung over them and pointed out their
line of travel. Just how many of them there
were in the herd the most experienced cattleman
could not guess, for the flanks of the
drove as well as its leading members were far
out of sight. There were more than a dozen
outfits mixed up together, no attempt having
been made to keep them apart; nor was there
any effort made to control their movements
beyond keeping them headed toward the West
Fork of Trinity, the nearest point at which
water could be obtained. The suffering beasts
complained piteously as they plodded along,
and now and then deep mutterings of challenge
and defiance, followed by a commotion
somewhere in the herd, would indicate the spot
where perhaps a dozen of the half maddened
animals had closed in deadly combat. It was
little wonder that the sixty bronzed and
weather-beaten men who accompanied them
were in fighting humor, and ready to resist to
the death any interference with their efforts
to find water or grass. They were almost consumed<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
with thirst themselves. Every drop of
water they drank was brought along in the
wagon, and there was so little of it that no
one thought of taking more than a swallow at
a time. Scouts had been sent out early in the
morning with instructions to search everywhere
for a water-course, and it was as Mr.
Chisholm enquired about them, and handed
back the cup he had drained, that the sheriff
rode up and asked to see “the boss.”</p>

<p>“’Pears to me as if this outfit was bossing
itself,” replied Mr. Chisholm, facing about in
his saddle and looking sharply at the newcomers.
“You can see for yourself, without
looking, that all we can do is to keep the critters
pointed toward the West Fork. But you
don’t belong on our side of the house. Where
might you hail from?”</p>

<p>“I am sheriff of this county, and came out
to tell you that you must not trespass on the
grounds of our farmers,” answered the officer.</p>

<p>“Well, then, what do you come to us for?”
enquired Mr. Chisholm, while the men around
him scowled savagely and played with the
locks of their rifles. “Go and serve your<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
warning on the critters. Can’t you see that
some of them are miles ahead of us? How are
we going to turn them back when our horses
are nigh about as ready to drop as the cattle
are? I tell you it can’t be done!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know it means ruin to us farmers
if we allow those famishing cattle to get
into our fields?” demanded the brown-whiskered
man, who seemed quite as ready and
willing to fight as the cattlemen were. “They
will break down our fences and eat up the
very crops on which our lives depend. Besides,
there are no more grass and water in
the country than we want ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I’m powerful sorry to hear you say that,
but I don’t see what we are going to do about
it,” said Mr. Chisholm. “We’ve got to go
somewhere now that we have started.”</p>

<p>The sheriff opened his lips to speak, but
the brown-whiskered man was too quick for
him.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you are going to do
about it, don’t you?” he said, with a savage
emphasis. “Well, I will tell you. When
you get to the top of that swell yonder you<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
will see, a couple of miles off, a long line of
willows.”</p>

<p>“Now, if that isn’t the best piece of news I
have heard for a week I wouldn’t say so!” exclaimed
the cattleman. “Where there’s timber
there is water, of course. I thought the
critters were a-travelling along a trifle pearter
than they were a while back. Sam, you drive
on ahead with the wagon and fill up the cask,
and the rest of us will kinder scatter out on
the flanks and head the critters toward the
willows our friend speaks of.”</p>

<p>“Will you let me get through with what I
have to say?” shouted the farmer, his face
growing white with anger. “You go near
those willows if you dare! There are more
than two hundred men hidden among them,
and if our pickets can’t turn your cattle back
they’ll shoot them!”</p>

<p>“Will, eh?” exclaimed Mr. Chisholm, his
face wearing a good-natured smile, that was
very aggravating to the brown-whiskered
farmer. “I hope not, for if you shoot our
stock we’ll have to shoot you to pay for it.
Look a-here,” he added, turning his horse<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
about and riding up close to the man he
was addressing, “I tell you once for all,
stranger&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold! I command the peace!” cried the
sheriff, seeing that the men and boys around
the wagon were moving up to support their
leader. “Keep back, all of you!”</p>

<p>“The peace hasn’t been broken yet,” replied
Mr. Chisholm, “and I assure you that I and
my friends have no intention of breaking it;
but our watchword is, ‘Grass and water, or
blood!’ and it is for you to decide which it
shall be. We are not the men to stand by
with our hands in our pockets and see our
stock perish for want of something to eat and
drink, and you misjudge us if that is the
kind of fellows you took us for. You farmers
were very kind to yourselves when you ran
your fences along every water-course in the
State, so’t we cattlemen could not get to
it. Water’s free and we want our share
of it.”</p>

<p>“But our land has been paid for, and you
have no right to come upon it after we have
told you to keep off,” said the farmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[9]</span></p>

<p>“Some of you have paid for the land you
raise crops on and some are squatters the
same as we cattlemen are,” answered Mr.
Chisholm, becoming earnest, but still fighting
to keep down his rising anger. “There are
miles and miles of these streams been fenced
in and shut off from us stock-raisers without
any warrant of law, and now we are going to
walk over some of them same fences.”</p>

<p>“If you attempt it we shall shoot you down
like dogs!” said the farmer fiercely, and as he
spoke he lifted his rifle an inch or two from
the horn of his saddle, as if he had half a
mind to begin the shooting then and there.</p>

<p>“Easy, easy, Mr. Walker,” interposed the
sheriff, laying his hand upon the angry man’s
arm. “We’ve got the right on our side and
the whole power of the State behind us, and
there’s no need that you should get yourself
into trouble by taking matters into your own
hands. I warn you to turn back,” he continued,
addressing himself to Mr. Chisholm.
“I am an officer of the law, and if you do not
pay some attention to what I say I shall be
obliged to arrest you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>The cattleman laughed, not loudly, but
heartily and silently.</p>

<p>“I reckon you’re a new man who has just
been put into office,” said he, as soon as he
could speak. “If you were an old hand at
the business you would know that it would
take pretty considerable of a posse to arrest
any man in this outfit. I wouldn’t try it if I
were sheriff.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have heard my warning,” said
Mr. Walker, “and the blame for whatever
happens will be on your own head. Nearly
all the farmers in the county have assembled
to resist your advance, and they sent me out
here to tell you that you have come far
enough. Now, will you turn back or not?”</p>

<p>“I aint got much patience with a man who
has two good eyes in his head to keep on asking
such a question as that. Of course we’ll
not turn back! We can’t!”</p>

<p>“Then we shall drive you back,” said Mr.
Walker. “That’s all there is about it. Because
the drought has ruined your business
you need not think we are going to let you
ruin ours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[11]</span></p>

<p>The farmer rode away, shaking his head and
muttering to himself, and paying no sort of
attention to the sheriff, who spurred to his
side and tried to reason with him. After a
while the sheriff came back to expostulate
with the leader of the cattlemen; but the
latter waved him aside.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you, Mr. Officer,” said he.
“You have done nothing but duty in warning
us not to trespass on them farmers’
grounds, but you see how we are fixed, don’t
you? We can’t stop where we are. All the
cowboys in Texas could not turn the critters
back now that they have got a sniff of the
water that is flashing along sparkling and
cold behind them willows, and what is there
left for us but to go on? All we ask of you
and your posse is to keep out of the way.
We cattlemen know how to take care of
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you see that I can’t keep out of
your way?” demanded the sheriff. “As an
officer it is my duty to oppose your further
progress!”</p>

<p>“Then it will be my duty to ride over you<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
rough-shod,” said the cattleman cheerfully.
“I don’t want to do that, for you seem to be a
good sort, even if you are an officer. If you
will be governed by the advice of one who
knows more about this country and the men
who live in it than you are ever likely to
learn, you will ride down to the willows and
tell them farmers to fall back and give our
perishing stock a chance at the water. If
they will listen to you there will be no
trouble. Me and my friends will camp nigh
the stream to-night, hold a council of war in
the morning, and like as not we’ll come to
some sort of an understanding. But I can’t
spend any more time with you. If you or the
farmers are going to force a fight upon us, we
must get ready for it.”</p>

<p>So saying Mr. Chisholm waved his hand to
the officer and rode away, leaving us three
boys from the North, who had ridden up close
to hear this consultation and the threats it
contained, in a state of dreadful uncertainty.
We had come from our homes, somewhere
near Denver, which at that time was little
more than a sprinkling of miner cabins, with<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
no such thoughts as this in our minds, and
here we were right in the midst of it&mdash;civil
war! We had come down there to invest a
few hundred dollars in cattle. We thought
we could make something by it. By keeping
far to the eastward, along the banks of the
Red River, we had got beyond reach of the
Comanche and Kiowas and other Indians
who felt inclined to steal everything we had,
and then by turning rapidly to the west had
found ourselves right among the cattlemen
almost before we knew it.</p>

<p>You remember that there were three of us
boys&mdash;Elam Storm, now no longer moody and
reticent, but hail fellow well met with everybody,
for we had found the nugget of which
he had been in search for so many years;
Tom Mason, who went by the name of
“Lucky Tom”; and myself, Carlos Burton,
upon whom devolves the duty of writing this
story. We had seen some adventures during
our long ride, some that I would gladly like
a chance to relate; but they differed so
widely from the scenes we passed through
among those cattlemen that I am glad to pass<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
them by to tell this story of “Tom Mason’s
luck.” Tom was a lucky fellow, that’s a fact,
and for a runaway boy he had a good deal of
pluck. I don’t know that he thought of making
any money at the time he was working
with us, but at the same time he took the
right way to get it. You know he was trying
to scrape together five thousand dollars, the
amount he stole from his uncle&mdash;a large sum
for a boy of his age to make; but he had that
amount and more too when he went home. I
will tell all about it when I get to it.</p>

<p>At length, when we had been so long on our
journey that Elam and Tom declared that I
had missed my way, we ran across a fence,
and that night we struck the farmer’s house.
I noticed that there was corn on the other side
of the fence, and that instead of being healthy
and green and thrifty-looking, it was stunted
and its leaves were beginning to turn yellow.
It looked as though it was all ready to gather,
only there was not the sign of an ear on any
of the stalks that we could see. I found out
the reason for this when we put up at the
farmer’s house that night,&mdash;the first house we<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
had stayed in since leaving Uncle Ezra’s,&mdash;when
he told us that there had not been a
drop of rain in that part of Texas for sixteen
months. Water was beginning to get scarce,
and the worst of it was, the grass on the
school-lands, miles away where all these cattle
were pastured, was burning up, and they
expected every day to find an army of famishing
cattle coming down upon them.</p>

<p>“And that’s something we can’t stand,”
said the farmer. “We have only a little
grass and water for our own use, and those
cattle will use up all we have got. More than
that, they will break down our fences and
ruin our crops so that we shan’t have a thing
to go on. That’s one thing we have to contend
with in Texas&mdash;long droughts.”</p>

<p>That was one thing I hadn’t thought of,
and when we started the next day I took
particular notice of the grass and water and
found that they were tolerable scarce, every
little mud hole in which there was water
being fenced in to keep their stock away from
it. I had never been in that part of Texas
before, and I found that water was hard<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
to get at, we having to fill our bottles to last
us all day; but I supposed it was characteristic
of the country. Of course the little
stock that the farmers had was thrifty and
fat, as well they might be, for they had water
enough, only not as much as they wanted;
but the farther we went into the country the
worse grew the situation. We often had to
beg for water, and it was the first time I ever
did such a thing in my life.</p>

<p>At last we got beyond the range of the
farmers, and then we found what suffering for
water meant. We were generally able to find
a mud hole or two in which water had been,
and which was not entirely dry, and by digging
down in it would get enough to quench
our thirst, and there we would stay until the
next morning to enable our horses to gain
strength enough to carry us; but there was no
grass for them to eat. Everything was dried
up. Two nights we spent without water. We
had enough in our bottles for ourselves, but
our poor horses were obliged to go thirsty.
Elam I knew was all right. He would keep
on until I gave the word to go back, and if his<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
horse played out, he would shoulder his pack
and go ahead on foot, but I looked for a complaint
from Tom. It is true he looked pretty
glum when his horse came up to him in the
morning and said as plainly as he could that
he was thirsty, and Tom could count every
bone in his body, but never a word of protest
did I hear from him. He would get on and
ride as if nothing was the matter.</p>

<p>One afternoon we came within sight of a
long line of willows which we knew lined a
stream, the first we had seen for many a day,
and near them was a large herd of cattle
ranging about and trying to find enough to
eat. A little nearer to us, on a little rise of
ground, we saw a horse, his rider having dismounted
to give him a chance to browse. He
saw us as soon as we did him, and shaded his
eyes with his hand and looked at us. Then
he picked up his rifle and held it in the hollow
of his arm.</p>

<p>“What is he going to do?” said Tom. “Is
he going to try to keep us away from that
water?”</p>

<p>“We will soon know,” I replied. “I never<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
knew a cowboy to be armed with a rifle before.
It proves that there has been somebody here
after his water, and he wants to be prepared
to meet them at long range.”</p>

<p>It was four miles to where he was, and it
took us all of an hour to get up there. It
seemed as if our horses couldn’t raise a trot to
save their lives. As we made no move to raise
our weapons, he finally dropped his to the
ground and leaned upon it.</p>

<p>“How-dy!” said I, as soon as we got within
speaking distance. That is the term that
Western men always use in addressing one
another. “I’m almost dead for a drink, and
have come here to see if you would give us
some.”</p>

<p>“You are alone, I take it?” said the cowboy.</p>

<p>“We are alone,” said I.</p>

<p>“There’s nobody behind you with a big
drove of cattle, is there?”</p>

<p>“Nobody at all. We came down here to
buy stock, but I don’t believe we want any
now.”</p>

<p>“You can have all we’ve got,” said he, with<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
a smile. “We’ll sell ’em to you at a dollar
apiece.”</p>

<p>I looked around at the walking skeletons he
was willing to dispose of at so meagre a price.
They were too far away for me to see much
of them, but still I could tell that they were
gaunt and scraggy in the extreme. Some of
them were lying down flat on their sides, with
their heads extended, and when a steer gets
that way he is in a bad fix.</p>

<p>“I had no idea that your steers were in such
shape,” said I. “Are some of them dead?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; there’s plenty of life left in them
yet. You will find plenty of water on the
other side of those willows. You see some
cattlemen came up here the other day from
the same direction you came from, looking for
grass and water, and said they were going to
come in at all hazards; that’s what made me
pick up my rifle when I saw you.”</p>

<p>“We aint seed no cattlemen down this
way,” said Elam. “We aint seed anything
but farmers.”</p>

<p>We were too thirsty to waste any more time
in talking, and so we rode down on the other<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
side of the willows to find the “plenty of
water” the cowboy spoke of. Well, there
was plenty of it, such as it was, but it was
scattered along the creek in little holes, and
had been trampled in by the cattle until it was
all roiled up; a filthy place to drink, but boys
and horses went at it, and by the time we had
got all the water we wanted there wasn’t much
left in that hole. We filled our bottles, saw
our horses drink all they needed, and then
mounted and rode back to where we had left
the hospitable cowboy.</p>

<p>“I don’t call that plenty of water,” said
Tom, who nevertheless had been a good deal
revived by the hearty swig he had taken. “I
wish you had some of the water that was overflowing
the Mississippi valley when I left it.
It was enough to flood this whole country.”</p>

<p>“Well, pilgrim, it is enough for us, situated
the way we are now. I have seen the time
when that bayou down there was booming
full, and you would have to wait for a week
before you could cross it. I suppose you
would like a roof to shelter you to-night,
wouldn’t you?” said the cowboy. “Well, if<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
you will follow the creek up about ten miles, you
will find the ranch of Mr. Davenport, my boss.
He will give you plenty to eat and a shakedown,
but your horses will fare hard for grass.”</p>

<p>“Thank you! We would like something a
little different from the bacon and crackers we
have been living upon so long,” said I. “Mr.
Davenport isn’t so hard up as his cattle?”</p>

<p>“Oh, bless you, he’s got plenty. He got a
whole wagon load of things last night.”</p>

<p>Thanking the cowboy again for his kindness
in showing us the water, we rode away. The
route we followed took us directly through his
cattle, and I was not much surprised when I
remembered what the cowboy had said about
selling them for a dollar apiece. I never saw
such poverty-stricken cattle in my life. Even
the bulls paid no sort of attention to us, and
we told one another that we thought our trip
to Texas had not amounted to anything, and
that we would have to wait until the next
spring before we could take any cattle home
with us. While we were talking the matter
over, Tom pointed out in the distance the
whitewashed walls of Mr. Davenport’s ranch.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">MR. DAVENPORT’S SECRET.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">The nearer we approached to the ranch
the more like a home place it looked to
us, the only thing that did not appear natural
being the hayracks that were usually piled
up for the horses. These were all gone, thus
proving that the ranchman had not been able
to provide any more for the benefit of his
steeds that were to carry him and his cowboys
during all sorts of weather. Of course there
could be no hay while the grass that was to
furnish it was all burned up. As we drew
nearer we discovered a man and a boy sitting
on the porch. They did not wait for us to
speak to them, but the boy got up with his
face beaming all over with smiles, while the
man, who seemed to be a sort of invalid, kept
his chair.</p>

<p>“Strangers, you’re welcome to Hardscrabble,”
said he. “Alight and hitch. Your<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
horses won’t go very far away, and so you can
turn them loose.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said I. I was expected to
do all the talking. “Do we address Mr.
Davenport?”</p>

<p>“That is my name,” returned the invalid.
“And I see you are boys, too. Bob will be
glad of that. Come up here.”</p>

<p>It did not take us very long to remove our
saddles and bridles from our horses and carry
them up on the porch. Then we shook hands
with Mr. Davenport and his son Bob, and
took the chairs that were promptly brought
out to us.</p>

<p>“You are very young men to be travelling
around this way,” said the invalid. “I
shouldn’t think that your parents would
permit it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that we have any
parents to say what we shall do. We are
alone in the world, with the exception of Tom
here, who has an uncle in Mississippi. We
have come a thousand miles to buy some
cattle; but I don’t think, from what I have
seen of your cattle, that we shall want any.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, this drought is simply awful,” said
the invalid, rising up in his chair. “We
haven’t had a drop of rain for sixteen months,
and if it keeps on much longer we shall all die
in the poor-house. The route you came led
you through a portion of my herd. I want to
know if you ever saw such a sorry looking
lot of cattle as they are?”</p>

<p>This seemed to be the opportunity that Mr.
Davenport was waiting for, and he began and
told us all about those troublous times in
Texas during the past two years, and he said
that the drought and the farmers were to
blame for it. There had been a period in the
history of the State when the stockmen had
things all their own way; when their herds
roamed over almost two thousand square
miles of territory, going wherever grass and
water were most abundant, and attended by
only a few Mexican vaqueros, whose principal
business it was to see that their employer’s
outfit did not become mixed up with cattle
belonging to somebody else. But, of course,
this state of affairs could not continue forever
in a country like ours. The soil of Texas was<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
as well adapted to agriculture as it was to
stock raising, and it was not long before
people began to find it out.</p>

<p>When the tide of immigration begins setting
toward any State or Territory, it is
astonishing how quickly it will become filled
up. In a very short time the farmers grew to
be a power in the cattle lands of Texas. Of
course they settled along the water courses, or
as close to them as they could get, and when
they selected their land they fenced it in and
turned it up with the plough, thus depriving
the cattlemen of just so many acres of pasture,
and in some instances shutting them off
from the streams.</p>

<p>Of course, too, bad blood existed between
these two classes from the very first. The
cattlemen saw their limits growing smaller
day by day, and they did not take it very
much to heart when their half wild cattle
broke through the fences and ruined the fields
upon which the farmers had expended so
much labor; but they got fighting mad when
the farmers sued them in the courts and were
awarded heavy damages for their crops.<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
Neighborhood rows and civil wars on a
small scale were of common occurrence, and
during this particular summer the long to be
remembered drought came, and I could rest
assured of one thing, and that was, matters
were going to be brought to a climax. It was
surely coming, and the farmers would find
out one thing, and that was, that Mr. Davenport,
even if he was half dead from consumption,
could shoot as well as anybody.</p>

<p>For long months not a particle of rain fell
upon the parched soil, and when the school-lands,
on which large numbers of cattle grazed,
were utterly barren of verdure and rendered
worthless for years to come, and all the little
streams went dry, the ranchmen saw ruin
staring them in the face. The sufferings of
the walking skeletons, which represented
every dollar they had in the world, were
terrible in the extreme, and grass and water
must be had at any price. The nearest point
at which these could be had was on the West
Fork of Trinity. It was true that the most,
if not all, of the land in that vicinity had been
turned into farms and fenced in, but what did<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
the desperate cattlemen care for that? Grass
and water were the free gifts of Heaven, and,
if necessary, they were ready to fight for their
share.</p>

<p>What it was that induced Mr. Davenport to
say all this to me, an entire stranger, I cannot
imagine, unless it was because he was so excited
by the financial distress which he saw
hanging over him that he must tell it to somebody.
Sometimes during his narrative he
would get up out of his chair and pace back
and forth on the porch as if all his old strength
had come back to him. His eye would kindle,
until I made up my mind that if all the ranchmen
were like him there would be some shooting
before the summer was over. For myself
I heartily wished I was safe back where I
belonged.</p>

<p>“Do you own this land where you are
located?” I asked, feeling that I must say
something.</p>

<p>“No, nor does anybody else. We are squatters.
My neighbors tell me that there was a
time, not so very long ago, when this ranch
was located at least a hundred miles to the<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
east of where it is now; but the farmers
kept coming in until I am where I am now.
You can’t keep cattle where there is land
fenced in.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think that you are going
to drive your stock away from here toward
Trinity?”</p>

<p>“Because there were a couple of men here
from the lower counties, not three weeks ago,
to see if I would join in,” answered the invalid.
“You see my cattle would get all mixed up
with others and there is no telling when we
would get them apart. That will make it
necessary for me to hire some more men, and
as you haven’t got anything to do, why can’t
you hire out to me?”</p>

<p>“That’s an idea,” said I. “I will speak to
my companions about it and see what they
have to say. We would rather not have any
shooting&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will see plenty of it if you stay
around with us,” said Mr. Davenport. “The
minute we get near Trinity it will commence.
Why, there must be as much as one hundred
and seventy-five thousand head of cattle that<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
need watering. It’s all farms up that way
too.”</p>

<p>“I was about to say that we would rather
not have any shooting around where we are,”
I continued. “But if there is going to be any
we would rather be where we can have a hand
in it.”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble, is it?” said Mr. Davenport,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. And as far as paying us anything&mdash;why,
we are here with you now, and if you
will give us board it is all we ask.”</p>

<p>I looked at Tom and he nodded his head. I
glanced around for Elam, but he and Bob had
disappeared. They had got into conversation
and had gone off to look at something.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Mr. Davenport.
“That boy has been confined here on the
ranch and he has not seen a companion
before. I have been afraid to let him out
of my sight. By the way, this man whom
you have just introduced to me is all
right?”</p>

<p>“Who? Elam? Oh, yes! You can trust
him anywhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>“I mean he wouldn’t let harm come to Bob
without making a fuss about it.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said I, rather astonished at the
proposition. “I don’t see that any harm can
come to him out here.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” said Mr. Davenport,
with a heavy sigh, which told how heavily
the matter bore on his mind, “I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Not to dwell too long on incidents that are
not connected with this story, I will simply say
that we were presented to two of the cowboys
that night at supper time as the fellows Mr.
Davenport had employed to help him drive
his cattle north, our duties to begin on the day
the march commenced. I took a great notion
to the two men&mdash;tall, rawboned, and rough,
and the simple and earnest manner in which
they agreed with their employer on all questions
concerning the conduct of the farmers, in
keeping his cattle out on the barren prairie
where there was neither water nor grass to
be had, made me think that their hearts were
in the matter.</p>

<p>During the next week I noticed that Bob
and Elam went off somewhere immediately<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
after breakfast and did not get back before
night. That was all right to me, but I wanted
to make sure that Elam knew what he was
doing, so one day when I got a chance to
speak to him in private I said:</p>

<p>“What do you and Bob do when you are
gone all day?”</p>

<p>“Sho!” said Elam, with a laugh. “He
just makes me lay under the trees and tell
him stories.”</p>

<p>“You are sure no harm comes to him?”</p>

<p>“Harm? What is going to harm him out
here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know and his father doesn’t know;
but if you are wise you will keep your eyes
open.”</p>

<p>“Harm!” repeated Elam. “Well; I should
like to see somebody harm him. He’s got a
good heart, that boy has. Be they going to
shoot him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what they are going to do, I
tell you. If his father ever tells me I will
tell you.”</p>

<p>During all this time Mr. Davenport kept
Tom and me close to himself. It was a companionship<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
that was entirely new to him in
that country, and he wanted to make the
most of it. Before I had been acquainted
with him twenty-four hours I could see that
he was different from most men who made
stock raising a business, that for years he
had been out there where he had nobody to
talk to, and I was sure he had some secret to
tell us. One day it all came out, as I knew it
would, if we let the matter alone and did not
trouble him with it. It was a hot day during
the first of August and we were sitting there
on the porch, trying to raise a little breeze by
fanning ourselves with our hats. It was after
dinner, and the Mexican cook had gone somewhere
to sleep and we were there alone.</p>

<p>“I haven’t always been what you see me
now,” said Mr. Davenport, settling back in
his chair as if he had resolved upon his
course. “I have a secret which I want to tell
Bob, but I don’t know how to go about it. It
isn’t anything of which I am ashamed,&mdash;many
men have done the same before me,&mdash;but somehow
I have let it go so long that it has become
a task to me. I want to ask your advice<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
about it. You are comparative strangers to
me, but somehow I have taken to you and
want to trust you. I haven’t had anyone
around me to whom I was willing to confide
it, and now I know that I am not long for this
world I want to see Bob have his rights.”</p>

<p>With these words the invalid began his
story. It was short, but we could both see
how great an effort it cost him.</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport was an old “forty-niner.”
He spent a few successful years in the gold
mines and then returned to the States, and
established himself as a wholesale merchant in
St. Louis, his native city, and soon became
known as one of its most enterprising business
men. The only relatives he had in the
world, except his son Bob,&mdash;who was not his
son in reality,&mdash;were an unmarried uncle, who
went to Texas and became a ranchman, and a
half brother, who was not a relative to be
proud of. Too lazy to work, this half brother,
whose name was Clifford Henderson, gained a
precarious living by his wits. He gambled
when he could raise a stake, and borrowed
of his brother when he couldn’t. He was<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
more familiar with the police court than he
was with the interior of a church, and when
his generous brother’s patience was all exhausted
and he positively refused to pay
any more of his debts, he left that brother’s
presence with a threat of vengeance on his
lips.</p>

<p>“I will get even with you for this,” said he.
“Bob is not your son, and I will see that you
don’t adopt him, either. Whenever I see a
notice of your death,&mdash;and you can’t live forever,&mdash;I
will hunt that boy up and make him
know what it is to be in want, as I am at this
moment.”</p>

<p>The fact that Bob was not his son ought not
to have weighed so heavily with the invalid as
it did, but still he could not bear to enlighten
him. He was the son of a friend in the gold
mines, who, dying there, left Bob alone, and
Mr. Davenport took him up. He christened
him Davenport, and the boy always answered
to his name. There never had been any doubt
in his mind that Bob would some day come in
for all his money, until this Clifford Henderson
began his threatenings; and even after that<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
Mr. Davenport did not wake up and attend to
things as he ought.</p>

<p>In process of time Mr. Davenport’s unmarried
uncle died, and in his will he made him
executor and heir to all the property he had
accumulated in Texas. In the hope that a
change in the climate might prove beneficial
to his health, as well as to leave that miserable
Clifford Henderson and all his threatenings
behind, Mr. Davenport moved to Texas
and took possession of his legacy, bringing
Bob with him. In fact, the two did not act
like father and son, but like two brothers who
could not bear to be separated. All they
found when they reached Texas was a rather
dilapidated old house, which was very plainly
furnished, and presided over by a half-breed
Mexican cook, who was so cross and surly that
one could hardly get a civil word out of him.
The rest of the help&mdash;there were four of them
in all&mdash;were cowboys. They spent the most
of their lives on the open prairie, looking out
for the safety of Mr. Davenport’s cattle.</p>

<p>“I have got everything&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport suddenly paused and put<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
back into his coat the large pocket book
which he had been in the act of showing to
us. Then he got upon his feet and carefully
closed the door leading into the cabin, and
walked cautiously to one end of the porch
and looked around the house, then to the
other end, but came back without seeing
anybody.</p>

<p>“One has to be careful,” said he, in explanation.
“I am as afraid of my help as of
anything else.”</p>

<p>“Of your help!” I exclaimed. “If there
is anybody here that you are afraid of, why
don’t you discharge him?”</p>

<p>“Because I want to see what he is here
for,” said the invalid. “He works for nothing
at all, but yet he always seems to
have plenty of money. You know ’Rastus
Johnson?”</p>

<p>Yes, we did know him, and he was one of
the few people about the ranch to whom I had
taken a violent dislike. He was just the man
to excite the contempt of a Texan, because he
couldn’t ride; but when he came to Mr.
Davenport’s ranch six months ago, and told a<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
pitiful story about the luck that had befallen
him in the mines, he was given odd jobs to do
about the ranch for his board. There were
two things that struck Mr. Davenport as
peculiar, or we might say three, and tempted
by something, he knew not what, he kept the
man around the house as much as possible
and watched his movements. One was the
care he took of his six-shooters. He had a
splendid pair, and when engaged in no other
occupation, he was always rubbing them up
until they shone like silver. The other was
his story about the mines. He did not know
that Mr. Davenport was an old forty-niner,
and he thought he could say what he pleased
to him and he would believe it. The nearest
mines that Mr. Davenport knew anything
of were those located about Denver, the
very place we had come from; and the idea
that anyone could walk a thousand miles,
right through a country settled up by cattlemen
and farmers, and be as poor as he was
when he struck Mr. Davenport’s ranch, was
ridiculous. But Mr. Davenport kept this to
himself. He had Clifford Henderson in mind,<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
and he resolved if ’Rastus attempted anything
out of the way he would expose him on
the spot.</p>

<p>As ’Rastus grew more and more at home
about the ranch, other qualities developed
themselves. He took to “snooping” around
the house to see what he could find there, and
once, when Mr. Davenport entered the ranch
suddenly, he was certain that he saw ’Rastus
engaged in trying to pick the lock of his
desk; but ’Rastus began tumbling up his
bed, and turned upon his employer with such
a hearty good-morning that the invalid was
inclined to believe he was mistaken.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, in response to Mr. Davenport’s
question; “I believe we know something
about ’Rastus. Some of the cowboys
have told us a good deal about him. Is he
the one you are afraid of?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got the whole thing right here,” said
Mr. Davenport, seating himself in his chair
and drawing a big fat pocket-book from his
inside pocket. “It contains my will, and also
instructions in regard to what I want Bob to
do with the rest of our herd in case any<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
escape the effects of the drought. It also contains
a full history of the manner in which he
came to me, and hints regarding those threats
of Henderson&mdash;whom I sincerely trust he may
never see again. In short, nothing that I
could think of has been omitted.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think that Henderson would
follow you down here, do you?” said Tom.</p>

<p>“My dear boy, you don’t know anything
about that man if you think he wouldn’t
follow me to Europe,” said Mr. Davenport
sadly. “If he is alive, Bob will hear from
him; and that he is still alive I am forced to
believe from the actions of this man Johnson.
I don’t expect to come back here, and I want
you two boys to swear to what I have told
you. You will, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Of course Tom and I agreed to it, and then
we wondered what sort of a man Clifford Henderson
could be to scare his half brother so
badly as that.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">’RASTUS JOHNSON.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Having no wish to pry into Mr. Davenport’s
affairs any further than he was
willing to reveal them to us, we did not question
the invalid, although there were some
points in his story that I should have liked to
have cleared up. He seemed to know that ’Rastus
Johnson was employed by Clifford Henderson,
and I wanted to know what reason he
had for thinking so; but he was sadly used
up by his talking, and settled back in his
chair in a state of complete exhaustion. It
was this state that troubled me. I began to
think that when his time came to go he would
go suddenly.</p>

<p>Presently Bob came up accompanied by
Elam. I strolled off to find ’Rastus Johnson.
You see I was as much interested in that
pocket-book Mr. Davenport carried in his
coat as I was in anything else. ’Rastus Johnson<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
must have known that he carried it there,
and if anything should happen while the
invalid was alone the pocket-book would be
found missing; and without a will where
would Bob be? Henderson could claim his
property as next of kin, and Bob would be left
out in the cold. I knew that Tom understood
all this as well as I did. At any rate I would
speak to him about it the very first chance
I had, and arrange it with him so as to
keep Mr. Davenport under guard the whole
time.</p>

<p>It did not take me long to find ’Rastus
Johnson. The ranch stood on the edge of a
little grove, and there, under one of the trees,
I found the man of whom I was in search.
His hat was pulled over his eyes, as if he
were fast asleep, and the belt containing his
revolvers lay near him on the ground. Evidently
they had just received an extra rubbing.
He started up as he heard my footsteps
and pulled the hat off his face.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it?” said he, with a long-drawn
yawn. “How-dy. What does the old
man have to say to you? He says more to<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
you than he has to me, and I’ve been on this
ranch for three months.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he has had a good deal to say to Tom
and me. He has been telling us about the
threats of Clifford Henderson. Seen anything
of him lately?” I asked, as if I didn’t care
whether or not he answered my question.</p>

<p>I asked this abruptly, as I meant to do, and
the answer I got set all my doubts at rest.
The man was in the employ of Henderson&mdash;that
was a fact; and while he used his own
time in getting his wits about him, I busied
myself in giving him a good looking over.
He was a giant in strength and stature, long
haired and full bearded, and when he sat up
and looked at me, I knew I was looking into
the eyes of a desperado of the worst sort.
His clothes were not in keeping with the story
of poverty he had told when he first came
to Mr. Davenport’s ranch. They were whole
and clean, and his high-top boots looked as
though they had just come from the hands of
the maker. There was something about the
man that made me think he was wanted somewhere
else&mdash;that there was a rope in keeping<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
for him, if the parties who held it only knew
where to find him. He looked at me for fully
a minute without speaking, then rested his
elbows on his knees and looked down at the
ground.</p>

<p>“I don’t know the man,” said he, and he
spoke so that anybody could have told that
he was angry.</p>

<p>“There is no need of getting huffy about
it,” said I carelessly. “Where is he now?”</p>

<p>“I tell you I am not acquainted with the
man,” said he. “Henderson! I never heard
the name before.”</p>

<p>“No offence, I hope; but I thought from
the way you acted that you were in his
employ. Be honest now, and tell me when
you have seen him lately.”</p>

<p>“How have I acted?” enquired the man.</p>

<p>“Oh, snooping around the ranch and trying
to find out things that are not intended for
you to know,” I answered carelessly. “You
know you have been doing that ever since you
have been here, and Mr. Davenport is sorry
that he ever consented to let you remain.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you what I have done?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[44]</span></p>

<p>“There is but one thing he could put his
finger upon, and that was when you tried to
pick the lock of his desk.”</p>

<p>“I never&mdash;&mdash;” began Johnson.</p>

<p>“If you had got into it you wouldn’t have
made anything by it. The man’s papers are
safe.”</p>

<p>“I know he carries them on his person, and
he’s got a little revolver handy, bless the
luck. There now, I have let the cat out of the
bag! There’s no one around who can hear
what we say, is there? Sit down.”</p>

<p>I tell you things were going a great deal
further than I meant to have them. I had
come out there on purpose to induce Johnson
to drop a hint whether or not he was in Clifford
Henderson’s employ, but I had succeeded
almost too well. It looked as though the man
was going to take me into his confidence. It
was a dangerous piece of business, too, for I
knew if I did anything out of the way, I
would be the mark for the bullets in one of
Johnson’s shining revolvers.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why I should sit down,” I
replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>“Sit down a minute; I want to talk to you.
You have had bad luck with your cattle,”
said the man, as I picked out a comfortable
place to seat myself. “You once possessed a
large drove, but they were taken away from
you at one pop.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” I said. “If I could find the
men who did it, I wouldn’t ask the law to
take any stock in them. I would take it into
my own hands.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know anything about
that,” said the man. “I wasn’t there,
although, to tell you the truth, I have been in
at the bouncing of more than one herd of
cattle that was all ready to drive to market.”</p>

<p>“What got you in this business, anyway?”
I asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“What business?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know as well as I do. A man of
your education can make a living a great deal
easier than you do.”</p>

<p>“Look a-here, young fellow, I did not
agree to make a confidant of you in everything.
Perhaps I will do that after a while.
What I want to get at now is this: Are you<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
willing to work with me to have this property
go where it belongs?”</p>

<p>“Where does it belong?”</p>

<p>“You mentioned the name of the man not
two minutes ago&mdash;Clifford Henderson.”</p>

<p>“Aha! You do know that man, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and now you know my secret, for I
have got a secret as well as the old man,” said
Johnson; and as he spoke he reached out and
pulled his six shooters within easy handling
distance, turning the butt of one up, so that
he could catch it at a moment’s warning.</p>

<p>Now, I suppose some of my readers will
think I was in no danger about that time, but
I knew I was. My life hung upon the words I
uttered during the next few minutes. If I had
refused I would never have known what hurt
me. Johnson would have shot me down and
then reported to Mr. Davenport that I had insulted
him; and as there was no one present
to overhear our conversation, that would have
been the last of it. Law was not as potent
then as it is in Texas in our day, and Johnson’s
unsupported word would have been<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
taken, there being no evidence to the contrary.
I tell you I was in something of a fix.</p>

<p>“How does it come that Henderson has so
much interest in this property?” I enquired.</p>

<p>“Why, Bob is no relative of Davenport’s at
all. He picked him up in the gold mines,&mdash;where
his father died and left him,&mdash;named
him Davenport, and the boy has been brought
up to believe that he has an interest in all his
stocks and bonds. I wish I had known a little
more about that when I came here. I told the
old man some funny stories about my being in
the gold mines,” he added, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“And Henderson doesn’t want him to have
it. It seems to me that it would be the part
of policy for Henderson to come here and live
with Mr. Davenport.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that wouldn’t do at all!” exclaimed
the man hastily. “He used to live with him
in St. Louis, but they had an awful row when
they separated, and he is afraid the old man
will go to work to adopt the boy. I tell you
he don’t want him to do that!”</p>

<p>“It seems very strange that Mr. Davenport
hasn’t adopted him before this time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[48]</span></p>

<p>“I lay it to his illness as much as anything.
Like all persons who are troubled with an
incurable disease, he thinks something will
happen to take him off the minute he adopts
Bob, and I tell you it’s a lucky thing for us.
Well, what do you say?”</p>

<p>“I don’t propose to go into this thing until
I know how much there is to be made out of
it,” I answered, as if I had half a mind to go
into it. “How much are you going to get?”</p>

<p>“I am not going to take my pay in half-starved
cattle, I tell you,” said Johnson
emphatically. “The old man has a few thousand
dollars in bonds in some bank or another,&mdash;I
don’t know which one it is,&mdash;and
when I get that pocket-book in my hands I
shall get some of those bonds. I won’t let it
go without it. He ought to give you as much
as he gives me.”</p>

<p>“How much are you going to get?” I said
again.</p>

<p>“Twenty thousand dollars; and what I
want more than anything else is that pocket-book.
He has got his will in there, and I must
have that before anything is done. Now, if<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
you can steal that pocket-book and give it to
me, I’ll see that you are well paid for your
trouble. If Henderson gives you five thousand
dollars it would go a long way toward
straightening up your cattle business.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want some time to think about it.
It is a pretty dangerous piece of work.”</p>

<p>“Take your own time. We shall not go off
until next week. You won’t say anything to
Bob or the old man about it?”</p>

<p>“Never a word,” I replied, hoping that he
wouldn’t ask me to keep still where Tom and
Elam were concerned. I couldn’t possibly get
along without taking them into my confidence,
for although it was new business to
them, I felt the want of a little good advice.</p>

<p>“Because if you do&mdash;if I see you riding off
alone with either one of those fellows I shall
know what you are up to, and then good-by
to all your chance of getting any money.”</p>

<p>“You need have no fear,” said I, getting
upon my feet. “I shall not say a word to
either one of them.”</p>

<p>I walked slowly toward the ranch, feeling
as if I had signed my own death warrant.<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
There was no bluster about Johnson, he
wasn’t that sort; but I knew that I not only
would lose all chances of getting any money
by going off riding with Mr. Davenport or
Bob, but I would lose my chance of life. I
would be shot down at once the first time I was
caught alone, and, with all my practice at
revolver drawing,&mdash;that is, pulling it at a
moment’s warning,&mdash;I would not stand any
show at all. These Texans are a little bit
quicker than cats when it comes to drawing
anything.</p>

<p>“Of all the impudence and scandalous
things that I ever heard of, that ’Rastus
Johnson is the beat,” I soliloquized as I
walked toward the house, wondering what I
should do when I got there. “A man comes
out to steal a will from another man and
pitches upon me, an entire stranger, because I
have had ill luck with my cattle. Of course I
have no intention of doing anything of the
kind, but if something should happen to
get this fellow into serious trouble&mdash;&mdash; By
gracious! if this man was lynched he could
take me with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>When I reached the ranch and mounted the
steps that led to the porch I found Tom and
Elam sitting there alone. Mr. Davenport had
talked himself into a state of complete exhaustion
and had gone in to take a nap, taking
Bob with him as guard. In order to
secure the quietness he wanted they had
closed the door after them. I felt that now
was my only chance. I saw by the look of
surprise on Elam’s face that Tom had been
hurriedly whispering to him what Mr. Davenport
had told us.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” enquired Tom.
“We have been waiting half an hour for you.”</p>

<p>“Is it a fact that this Johnson has been
working for Clifford Henderson?” exclaimed
Elam. “If I was in Davenport’s place I
would drive him off the ranch.”</p>

<p>“Sh&mdash;! Don’t talk so loud,” I admonished
him. “I’ve been gone half an hour, and during
that time I have heard some things that
will astonish you. I have learned that Johnson
is in Henderson’s employ, and that he
wants me to act as his accomplice.”</p>

<p>I uttered these words in a whisper, thinking<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
of the listening ones there might be on the
other side of that door, and when I got
through I tiptoed first to one end of the porch
and then to the other to keep a lookout for
Johnson. I was afraid of the “snooping”
qualities that the fellow had developed, and if
he had suddenly come around the corner of the
house and caught me in the act of whispering
to my friends I would not have been at all
surprised at it. Tom and Elam were both
amazed at what I had told them, and looked
at one another with a blank expression on
their faces.</p>

<p>“Tom, he wants me to steal that pocket-book
Mr. Davenport showed us to-day,” I continued.
“He says the will is in there and he
can’t do anything without it. He says the
property rightfully belongs to Henderson.”</p>

<p>“If I were in your place I would go right
straight to Mr. Davenport with it,” said Tom,
speaking in a whisper this time.</p>

<p>“And be shot for your trouble,” chimed in
Elam, waking up to the emergencies of the
case.</p>

<p>“That’s the idea, exactly,” I went on.<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
“He would shoot me down as soon as he
would look at me, and then report to Mr.
Davenport that I had insulted him; then
what could anybody do about it? You fellows
would have to shoot him, and that would
end the matter. I promised I wouldn’t say
anything to Bob or his father about it, but I
had a mental reservation in my mind when it
came to you. Now I want to know what I
shall do about it.”</p>

<p>“Tell us the whole thing, and then perhaps
we can pass judgment upon it,” whispered
Tom. “I don’t know that I understand
you.”</p>

<p>With that I began, and gave the boys a full
history of my short interview with Johnson.
It didn’t take long, for I did not hold a very
long conversation with ’Rastus; and when I
came to tell how readily he had included me
in his plans I saw Elam wink and nod his head
in a very peculiar manner. Then I knew that
I had hit the nail squarely on the head when
I made up my mind what ’Rastus would do to
me if things didn’t work as he thought they
ought to. I tiptoed to the end of the porch<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
to see if I could discover any signs of him,
and then I came back.</p>

<p>“You see he knows that I have had bad
luck with my cattle, and he takes it for
granted that I am down on everybody who
has been fortunate with theirs,” I said, in
conclusion. “He thinks I want to steal
enough to make up for my lost herd.”</p>

<p>“The idea is ridiculous,” said Tom. “How
in the world does he suppose Mr. Davenport
had anything to do with your loss?”</p>

<p>“That aint neither here nor there,” said
Elam. “That feller has stolen more than
one herd of cattle, an’ I’ll bet on it. I
shouldn’t wonder if he was one of them desperate
fellows&mdash;what do you call them&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Desperadoes,” suggested Tom.</p>

<p>“I know he is,” said I. “And he is a man
of education. He doesn’t talk as the Texans
do at all, and I told him that a person of his
learning could make a living easier than
he did.”</p>

<p>“What did he say to that?”</p>

<p>“He said he didn’t agree to make a confidant
of me in everything. He might do it<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
after a while. He acknowledged that he had
been in at the stealing of more than one herd
that was all ready to be driven to market.
Now, fellows, what shall I do about it?”</p>

<p>This was too much for Tom, who settled
back in his chair and looked at Elam. Our
backwoods friend arose to the emergency, and
I considered his advice as good as any that
could be given.</p>

<p>“You can’t do nothing about it,” he said,
after rubbing his chin thoughtfully for a few
minutes. “Let him go his way, an’ you go
yours.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and then see what will happen to
me if I don’t do as he says. Suppose he
thinks I have had time to steal that pocket-book?
If I don’t give it over to him, then
what?”</p>

<p>“Tell him that Mr. Davenport keeps a
guard over it all the while,” said Elam,
“an’ that you can get no chance. Heavings
an’ ’arth! I only wish I was in your
boots.”</p>

<p>“I wish to goodness you were,” said I.
“What would you do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[56]</span></p>

<p>“I’d let him go his way, an’ I’d go mine.
That’s all I should do.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s the best I could do under
the circumstances,” said I, after thinking the
matter over. “By the way, I think it is
about time you two went out on your ride.
I am of the opinion that it will be safer so.
Leave me here alone, so that when Johnson
comes up&mdash;&mdash; I do not believe his name is
Johnson; do you?”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t nary one of his names, that name
aint,” said Elam emphatically. “His name
is Coyote Bill.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” Tom and I managed
to ask in concert.</p>

<p>“I aint never seen the man; I aint done
nothing but hear about him since I have been
here, but I know he is Coyote Bill,” replied
Elam doggedly. “At any rate that’s the way
I should act if I was him.”</p>

<p>Coyote Bill was emphatically a name for
us to be afraid of. We had done little else
than listen to the stories of his exploits since
we had been in Texas. He didn’t do anything
very bad, but he would steal a herd of<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
cattle,&mdash;it didn’t make much difference how
many men there were to guard them,&mdash;run
them off to a little oasis there was in the
Staked Plains, and slaughter them for their
hides and tallow; and when the story of the
theft had been forgotten, two of his men
would carry the proceeds of their hunt to
some place and sell them. He never killed
men unless they resisted, and then he shot
them down without ceremony. Many a time
have we sat on the porch after dark when the
cowboys were there, listening to the stories
about him, and if this man was Coyote Bill he
must have been highly amused at some things
that were said about him. We were both
inclined to doubt the story of his identity.
No one had ever seen Coyote Bill, and how
could Elam tell what he looked like?</p>

<p>“Elam, you are certainly mistaken,” said
I; and the more I thought of his story the
less credit I put in it. “If you had seen
Coyote Bill I should be tempted to believe
you; but you know you have never met
him.”</p>

<p>“And then just think what he has done?”<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
added Tom. “He comes up here and agrees
with Carlos, a man whom he had never seen
before, to go in cahoots with him. The idea
is ridiculous. And how did Clifford Henderson
fall in with him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about that,” returned
Elam, as if his mind was fully made
up. “I’ll tell you what I’ll do: I’ll bet that
Carlos dassent call him Coyote Bill to his
face!”</p>

<p>“You may safely bet that, for I aint going
to do it,” said I, looking around the corner
of the house. “Here he comes, boys. You
had better get on your horses and make tracks
away from here.”</p>

<p>The boys lost no time in getting off the
porch and to their horses, which they had left
standing close by with their bridles down, so
that they would not stray away. They swung
themselves into their saddles with all haste,
and I sat down to await the coming of Coyote
Bill, if that was his real name, and to think
over what I had heard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ELAM’S POOR MARKSMANSHIP.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">“Coyote Bill!” I kept repeating to
myself. That name had probably been
given to him by the Texans on account of his
being so sneaking and sly&mdash;so sly that none of
the men he had robbed had ever been able to
see him. What his other name was I didn’t
know. While I was turning the matter over
in my mind Bill came around the corner. I
confess he did not look like so dangerous a
fellow, and if I had met him on the prairie
and been in want, I should have gone to him
without any expectation of being refused.
He looked surprised to see me sitting there
alone.</p>

<p>“Where are they?” he asked, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Whom do you mean?” I enquired, being
determined, if I could, to answer no questions
except those he had on his mind. How did I
know whom he referred to when he spoke of<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
“they,” and wanted to know where they
were?</p>

<p>“I mean the old man and Bob, and all the
rest of them,” he added. “I thought they
were here with you.”</p>

<p>“Tom and Elam have gone off riding,&mdash;there
they go,&mdash;and Mr. Davenport and Bob
have gone into the ranch to have a nap. I
can’t steal the pocket-book now, even if I
wanted to, for Bob is keeping guard over it.
It is true he don’t know what there is in it, but
he is keeping watch of his father all the same.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Carlos,” said Bill, coming up
close to the porch, “do you ever have charge
of the old man in that way?”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t been able to do any business
in almost a year, and I am getting
heartily tired of it.”</p>

<p>“What business do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Aw! Go on, now. You know what I
mean. I can’t steal cattle that are half
starved, for I wouldn’t make anything out of
them if I did. I am getting impatient, and
my boss is getting impatient, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[61]</span></p>

<p>“Well?” said I, when he paused.</p>

<p>“I want you to see if you can’t secure
possession of that pocket-book by to-morrow
night,” said Bill, in a quiet way that had a
volume of meaning in it. “You see, it isn’t
the will that Henderson cares for. The cattle
are pretty well gone up, and there won’t be
a third of them left when we get to Trinity.
What he cares most about is the bonds. If he
can get them in his hands he will be all right.”</p>

<p>“Why, Coyote Bill&mdash;&mdash;” I began.</p>

<p>I stopped suddenly, with a long-drawn gasp,
for I had done the very thing I was willing to
bet Elam I would not do. Bill started and
looked at me closely, and one hand moved to
the butt of his revolver. My heart was in my
mouth. Coyote Bill’s face was a study, and I
was sure my slip of the tongue had hit him in
a vital spot. Understand me, I didn’t speak
his name knowing what I was doing, but
because I couldn’t help myself. The idea
that I was to steal that pocket-book at twenty-four
hours’ notice was more than I could
stand, and I blurted out the first words that
came into my mind. I never had had much<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
practice in studying out the different emotions
that flit across a person’s mind, but I
was sure that in Coyote Bill’s expression both
rage and mirth struggled for the mastery&mdash;rage,
that I had suddenly found out his name
since I had left him; and mirth, because I, an
unarmed boy, should stand there and call him
something which he didn’t like too well anyway.
So I resolved to put a bold face on the
matter.</p>

<p>“See here, Bill&mdash;&mdash;” was the way I began
the conversation.</p>

<p>“Who told you that was my name?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Why, Bill, I have done nothing but hear
about you and your doings since I have been
here,” I answered. “You certainly do not
pretend to say you are not what I represented
you to be?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s neither here nor there,” said
he, taking his hand away from his pistol.
“You are a brave lad; I will say that much
for you, and you ought to be one of us.
What’s the reason you can’t steal the pocket-book
by to-morrow night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[63]</span></p>

<p>I drew a long breath of relief. The worst of
the danger was passed, but the recollection of
what might be done to me after a while made
me shudder. I had half a mind to slip away
that very night, but I knew that Elam would
scorn such a proposition. He meant to stay
and see the thing out. I tell you I wished he
stood in my boots, more than once.</p>

<p>“Because Bob is keeping guard over it,” I
said. “He don’t know what there is in it, I
tell you; but he has been made to understand
that there is something in it that concerns
himself, and so he is keeping an eye on it.”</p>

<p>“Does he know that he is in danger of
losing it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he does; but he don’t know where
the trouble is coming from.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have got hold of my name, and
I wish you hadn’t done it,” said Bill, looking
down at the ground and kicking a chip away
with his foot. “Be careful that you don’t
use it where anybody else can hear it. Perhaps
I can find some other way to get it. Do
you sleep very sound?”</p>

<p>I don’t know what reply I made to this question,<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
for it showed me that Bill was about to
attempt something after we had retired to
rest. I made up my mind that he would try
it too, but whether or not he would succeed
in getting by Elam was a different story
altogether. I made it up on the spur of the
moment to take Elam into my confidence.
He was a fellow who could remain awake for
three or four nights, and in the morning he
would be as fresh and rosy as though he had
enjoyed a good night’s sleep.</p>

<p>“You want to sleep pretty soundly to-night,
whatever you may do on other occasions,”
said Bill, in a very decided manner.
“I shan’t be here in the morning.”</p>

<p>He went off, whistling softly to himself, and
I went back to my chair and sat down. They
told us, when we first talked of going to
Texas, that we would find things very different
there, and indeed I had found them so. In
Denver, if a man had betrayed himself in the
same careless manner that Coyote Bill had
done, he would have been shot on sight; but
here were three boys who knew what Bill had
done, some of whom had the reputation of<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
being quick to shoot, and they were afraid to
do a thing. It was the man’s fame as a quick
shot that stood him well in hand. When I
came to think of it, I was disgusted with
myself and everybody else. If anyone had
told me that I would turn out to be such a coward
I would have been very indignant at him.</p>

<p>The hot day wore away, and presently I saw
Tom and Elam coming back. They could not
stay away when they knew that something
was going on behind their backs. Mr. Davenport
and Bob came out; the cook began to
bestir himself, the dishes rattled in the
kitchen, and in a little while they told us that
supper was ready. Of course we had to be
as neat here as we had anywhere else, and
Elam and I found ourselves at the wash-basin.
There was no one in sight.</p>

<p>“Elam,” said I, in an excited whisper,
“whatever you do, you mustn’t go to sleep
to-night!”</p>

<p>“Sho!” answered Elam. “What’s going
on to-night?”</p>

<p>“Coyote Bill has made up his mind to steal
that pocket-book. He says that the bonds<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
are all he wants out of it. He means some
mining stocks, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed Elam, burying his face
in the towel, “how is he goin’ to work to
get it?”</p>

<p>“He intends to come in after we are all
asleep and feel under the pillows for it. He
asked me if I slept rather soundly at night,
and I don’t know what answer I made him;
but I thought of you and concluded you
could keep awake. I have found out, too,
that his name is Coyote Bill, just as you said
it was.”</p>

<p>“What did I tell you?” said Elam, delighted
to know that he had found out something
about the man. “I knowed that was
the way I would act if I was him. What did
he say when you told him?”</p>

<p>“He told me I was a brave boy and ought
to be one of ‘us,’ as he explained it. Does
he mean that I ought to belong to his gang
and help him steal cattle?”</p>

<p>“Sure! You couldn’t be one of him and
help do anything else, could you? How do
you reckon he is going to come in?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know. You will have to keep
wide awake and find out.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you I don’t sleep a wink to-night.
If he thinks he can get away with that
pocket-book let him try it; that’s all.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see why he should pick me
out as a brave boy and want me to join his
gang.”</p>

<p>“Well, Carlos, I will say this fur you,”
said Elam, putting the towel back on its nail
and rolling down his sleeves: “You have a
most innercent way of talkin’ when you get
into danger, an’ a man don’t think you know
that there is danger in it.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! I have been afraid that Bill
would shoot at any minute. I am really
afraid of him.”</p>

<p>“Old Bill doesn’t know it, an’ that’s what
makes him so reckless. I will go further an’
say you have a sassy way of talkin’. Now,
you finish washin’ an’ I’ll go in an’ set down.
Remember, I shan’t go to sleep at all
to-night.”</p>

<p>I was perfectly satisfied with the assurance.
You see it would not do for me to lie awake<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
and halt Bill when he came in for fear that he
would accuse me of treachery; but with Elam,
who wasn’t supposed to know anything about
the case, it would be different. I didn’t think
that Elam’s explanation amounted to anything
at all. In fact, I did not see how I
could have talked in any other way. If I had
become excited and reported the matter to
Mr. Davenport there would have been hot
work there in the cabin, for I didn’t suppose
that any of my companions would have let
Coyote Bill work his own sweet will on me.
Having finished washing I went into the cabin
and sat down. Bill was there, and he was devoting
himself to the eatables before him like
any other gentleman. I was astonished at
the man’s nerve.</p>

<p>Supper over, we went out on the porch,
lighted our pipes, and devoted two hours to
talking. The most of the conversation referred
to the time when the cattle would be
along and we should get ready to march to
Trinity. Everybody suspected that there was
going to be a fight up there before our cattle
would be allowed water, and we were a little<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
anxious as to how it would come out. We
expected to fight the sheriff and his posse and
all the Texas Rangers that could be summoned
against us; and we knew that these
men were just as determined as we were.
They were fighting for the crops upon which
they had expended so much labor, and it
wasn’t likely that they were men who would
give way on our demand.</p>

<p>“Let them take a look at our cattle,” said
Bob. “That will stop them. The man has
yet to be born who can resist the sight of their
terrible sufferings.”</p>

<p>“Those men up there would look on without
any twinges of conscience if they saw the
last one of our herds drop and die before their
eyes,” returned his father. “Here’s where
we expect to catch them on the fly: We shall
be a mile or so behind our cattle, which will
be spread out over an immense amount of
prairie, and when those cattle get a sniff of
the fresh water, fences won’t stop them. It is
the momentum of our cattle that will take
them ahead.”</p>

<p>I certainly hoped that such would be the<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
case, for I knew there would be some men
stationed along the banks of that stream who
were pretty sure shots with the rifle. I didn’t
care to make myself a target for one of them.</p>

<p>The conversation began to lag after a while,
and finally one of the cowboys remarked that
sleep had pretty near corralled him and he
reckoned he would go in and go to bed; and
so they all dropped off, Elam giving my arm a
severe pinch as he went by. There was one
thing about this arrangement that I did not
like. Bill always made his bunk under the
trees in the yard. He preferred to have it so.
He had been accustomed to sleeping out of
doors in the mines, and he was always made
uneasy when he awoke and found himself in
the house, for fear that he would suffocate.
When it rained he would gladly come into the
ranch and stay there for a week, if it stormed
so long. He gathered up the blankets and
the saddle which Mr. Davenport had loaned
him for a bed, bade us all a cheerful good-night,
and went out to his bunk. There were
three of us who knew better than that. His
object in sleeping out of doors was, in case<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
some of the men he had robbed found out
where he hung out, that he might have a
much better chance for escape.</p>

<p>“He’s a cool one,” I thought, as I went in,
pulled off my outer clothes, and laid down
on my bunk. “I’ll see how he will feel in
the morning.”</p>

<p>I composed myself to sleep as I always did,
and lay with my eyes fastened on the door;
for I knew that there was where that rascal
Bill would come in. Both the doors were
open, and Elam wouldn’t have the creaking
of hinges to arouse him. I laid there until
nearly midnight, and had not the least desire
to sleep, and all the while I was treated to a
concert that anyone who has slumbered in
a room with half a dozen men can readily
imagine. Such a chorus of snores I never
heard before, and what surprised me more
than anything else was, the loudest of them
seemed to come from Elam’s bunk. Was my
friend fairly asleep? I sometimes thought he
was, and was on the point of awakening him
when I heard a faint noise at the rear door&mdash;not
the front one, on which my gaze was fastened.<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
My heart beat like a trip-hammer.
Slowly, and without the least noise, I turned
my head to look in that direction, but could
see nothing. All was still for a few seconds,
and then the sound was repeated. It was a
noise something like that made by dragging a
heavy body over the floor; then I looked
down and could distinctly see a human head.
Bill had not come in erect as I thought he
was going to, but had crawled in on his hands
and knees, intending, if he were heard, to
lie down and so escape detection. Slowly he
crawled along until he came abreast of Elam’s
bunk and not more than six feet from it, and
then there was a commotion in that bunk and
Elam’s voice called out:</p>

<p>“Who’s that a-comin’ there? Speak
quick!”</p>

<p>An instant later, and before Bill had time
to reply the crack of a revolver awoke the
echoes of the cabin, and a short but desperate
struggle took place in Elam’s direction.
Then the pistol cracked again, and in an
instant afterward the intruder was gone. It
was all done so quickly that, although I had<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
my hand on my revolver under my pillow, I
did not have time to fire a shot.</p>

<p>“Elam!” I cried; “what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, that’s the quickest man I ever
saw,” stammered Elam. “I had two pulls
at him, but he knocked my arm out of the
way and got safe off.”</p>

<p>“Did you hit him?” I asked, knowing how
impossible it was for him to miss at that
distance.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. He hasn’t had time to get
fur away, an’ I say let’s go after him. I wish
he would give me another chance at him
at that distance. I’d hit him sure.”</p>

<p>By this time the whole cabin was in an
uproar. All started up with pistols in their
hands, and all demanded of Elam an explanation.
He gave it in a few words, adding:</p>

<p>“I knew mighty well that the fellow didn’t
come in here fur no good. That’s the way I
should have done if I had been him. He’s out
there now, an’ I say let’s go after him.”</p>

<p>“The villain was after my pocket-book,”
said Mr. Davenport, in evident excitement.
“He wouldn’t have got more than five or ten<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
dollars, for that is all there is in it. Lem, I
want you and Frank to listen to me,” he
added, seizing the nearest cowboy by the arm.
“I have been keeping ’Rastus Johnson here
until I could find out&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“’Rastus Johnson! That aint ary one of
his names,” shouted Elam. “His name is
Coyote Bill!”</p>

<p>That was all the cowboys wanted to hear.
In the meantime we had thrown off the blankets,
and jumping to our feet followed the
cowboys out of the ranch&mdash;all except Mr.
Davenport, who, knowing that the night air
wasn’t good for him, stayed behind to keep
guard over his pocket-book. I followed the
cowboys directly to the place of Bill’s bunk,
but when we got there it was empty. He and
his six-shooters were gone. I tell you I
breathed a good deal easier after that.</p>

<p>“Coyote Bill!” said Frank, leaning one
hand against the tree under which the fugitive
had made his bunk. “I wondered what that
fellow’s object was in coming here and passing
himself off for ’Rastus Johnson, and now I
know. Cattle is getting so that it doesn’t<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
pay to steal them, and he was here to get
the old man’s pocket-book.”</p>

<p>“And how does it come that Elam knows so
much about him?” asked Lem. “You are
a stranger in these parts, Elam.”</p>

<p>“I know I am; but that’s just the way I
should have acted if I was him,” returned
Elam, who began to see that he had made a
mistake in claiming to know the man. “I
said his name was Coyote Bill, an’ I struck
centre when I did it.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Davenport gave us the secret history
of that pocket-book, and wanted Tom and me
to swear to what he told us,” I interposed,
fearing that things were going a trifle too far.
“That man tried to hire me to steal that
pocket-book to-night, and that was the way
Elam came to get a shot at him.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t get nary a shot at him,” exclaimed
Elam. “I pulled onto him an’ he
struck up my arm.”</p>

<p>“Let us go in and talk to Mr. Davenport
about it,” said I, seeing that all I said was
Greek to the cowboys. “He will tell you as
much of the story as I can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[76]</span></p>

<p>“Did you know anything about this,
Bob?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Not a word. I am as surprised as you are
to hear it,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Coyote Bill!” said Lem, gazing into the
woods as if he had half a mind to go in pursuit
of the man. “What reason have you for
calling him that?”</p>

<p>“Because that’s the way I should have
acted if I was him,” answered Elam.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t pay to go after him,” said
Frank. “He has laid down behind a tree and
can see everything we do. Let’s go in and
talk to the old man about it.”</p>

<p>All this conversation was crowded into a
very short space of time. We hadn’t been
out there two minutes before we decided that
it would be a waste of time to pursue the outlaw,
and that we had better go in and see what
Mr. Davenport had to say about it, and I for
one was very glad to get away from his bunk.
Of course Bill was in ambush out there, and
how did I know but that he had a bead drawn
on me at that very moment? We followed
the cowboys into the house, and we found<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
Mr. Davenport sitting up on the edge of his
bed.</p>

<p>“You didn’t get him; I can see that very
plainly,” said he, as we entered. “I wish I
had never heard of him in the first place.”</p>

<p>“You have given us a history of that
pocket-book, sir,” said I, beginning my business
at once, “and I beg that you will repeat
it for the benefit of the cowboys. Frank and
Lem haven’t said much, but I believe from
their silence that they would like to know
something about it.”</p>

<p>“Elam, how did you find out that his name
was Coyote Bill?” enquired Mr. Davenport.
“That name has been bothering me more than
a little since you went out.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will allow me to explain
that,” said I. “When I told Elam the history
of that pocket-book, which I did as soon
as you and Bob had gone into the ranch to
have a nap, he jumped at the conclusion. He
said there wasn’t another man in this part of
the country who would have the cheek to act
that way.”</p>

<p>“Have I got to go all over that thing<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
again?” groaned Mr. Davenport. “Bob, my
first word is to you. I shall have that off my
mind, anyway. You are not my son.”</p>

<p>It was dark in the cabin, but I could tell by
the tones of his voice how great an effort it
was for him to say it. Then he went on and
told the story very much as he had told it to
me, and when he got through I did not hear
anything but the muttered swear words which
the cowboys exchanged with each other. It
was their way of expressing utter astonishment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE WEST FORK OF TRINITY.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">While Mr. Davenport was speaking I
noticed that Bob got up and settled
down close by his father as he sat on the
bunk, and placed his left arm around his
neck. He meant to assure him that any
revelations he would make would cause no
difference with him. The man was his father,
the only father he had ever known, and as
such he intended to acknowledge him. I
could see that Mr. Davenport was greatly
encouraged by this.</p>

<p>“There is only one thing that I blame you
for,” said Lem. “You ought to have taken
Frank and me into your confidence at once.”</p>

<p>“I tell you we would have made short work
with him,” added Frank. “The idea that
this Coyote Bill could come around here and
bum around as he has! It’s scandalous!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that his name was Coyote<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
Bill until Elam spoke it out,” returned Mr.
Davenport. “Where he got it, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Then, Elam, we’ll have to take you to task
for that.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it until just as we were
washing for supper,” explained Elam, “an’
then Carlos told me.”</p>

<p>“What have you to say to that, Carlos?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it myself until Bill proposed
that I should steal that pocket-book
before to-morrow night,” said I; and somehow
I couldn’t help feeling uneasy by the
determined way the two cowboys plied their
questions. “He surprised me so suddenly
that I spoke the first words that came into my
mind. I knew then that he was going to
make an attempt to steal it after we had
gone to bed, and so I told Elam that he
would have to keep awake and stop it. That
was the reason that Elam got those two
shots at him.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is a mighty funny thing how
a man of that reputation could come here
and pass himself off for an honest miner!”
said Lem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[81]</span></p>

<p>“If you had the cheek that man’s got you
could do anything,” I continued. “He said
I ought to be one of them. If he means by
that, that I ought to join one of his bands
and make my living by stealing cattle, he’s
a long ways out of his reach.”</p>

<p>“You will find the boys all right, because I
have confided in them,” said Mr. Davenport.
“And now I have confided in you. Don’t tell
what I have told you, please, and as soon as I
get to Trinity I will ride down to Austin and
have this affair settled up. I did not suppose
that man would trouble me away out here in
Texas.”</p>

<p>“Father,” said Bob, who had listened in
speechless wonderment to all the trouble he
had caused, “you ought to have left me in
the mines. You have had lots of bother
on account of me.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, you have not been the least
particle of bother,” said Mr. Davenport
hastily. “Now you know why it was that
I didn’t want you to go fishing or hunting
without me. I was afraid Henderson might
do you some damage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>“Did he want to kill me?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! I was afraid he might abduct
you. You haven’t seen him since you were
seven years old, and if he could have abducted
you then, and got you away where
you could have signed the papers&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why, father, my signature as a minor
wouldn’t have amounted to anything!”
said Bob.</p>

<p>“No; but he could have kept you until
you were twenty-one, and then your signature
would have amounted to something, I
guess. But I will talk to you more about
this in the morning. I have talked so much
that I am fagged out. You are sure you
don’t think any the less of me for what I
have done?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I do not!” said Bob, gently assisting
the invalid back upon his bed. “If all
the money you have should go to Henderson,
I should always think of you as I do now.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should think a great deal less of
myself,” replied Mr. Davenport emphatically.
“Bob, you will get it all. I could not rest
easy in my grave if I knew you were to be<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
cheated out of it. You five boys will bear
testimony to what I say? Thank you! Now,
Bob, cover me up from the night air. Good-night!”</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport sank back on his pillows
and soon breathed the sleep of exhaustion,
while the rest of us, who couldn’t bear to
think of lying down, went out upon the porch.
Of course I was glad to see that the cowboys
had got over their suspicions of Elam and
me, and one would have thought from some
expressions they used that such a thing had
never been heard of, even in Texas. We
lighted our pipes and sat down to smoke on
it, hoping that the thing would come clearer
to us under the influence of the weed. The
only thing the cowboys blamed Mr. Davenport
for was that he did not expose
Coyote Bill when he found out what his intentions
were. And how had Bill happened
to get acquainted with Henderson? That
was one thing that they could not understand.</p>

<p>“This thing isn’t settled yet, by a long
ways,” said Frank, who, having emptied one<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
pipe, filled up for a fresh smoke. “Just the
minute anything happens to the old man, that
fellow Henderson will come on here and lay
claim to that pocket-book. But Bob will
already have it safe in his good clothes. I
want to see the man that says it is his.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Lem. “He won’t say it a
second time, I bet you!”</p>

<p>“Father spoke about his keeping me until
I was twenty-one, and then my signature
would amount to something,” said Bob, when
the conversation lagged a little. “What
would Henderson do? I guess I’d know
more then than I do now.”</p>

<p>“That would make no difference,” said
Frank. “He could keep you on bread and
water until you would be glad to sign
anything.”</p>

<p>“Would he shut me up?” exclaimed Bob,
looking at me.</p>

<p>“He might put you into a lunatic asylum,”
I answered.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! And all the time I would
be as sane as he is!”</p>

<p>“That would make no difference, either,”<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
said Frank. “There are plenty of men who
run an insane asylum who would be glad to
take a patient on such terms as he could offer.
Ten or fifteen thousand dollars at the end of
six years would make him open his eyes.
Before you had been with him a week you
would see all sorts of things.”</p>

<p>“Well, this beats me!” gasped Bob.
“And I just as sane as anybody! Such
things aint right.”</p>

<p>“I know they are not right,” said Lem.
“There are plenty of things that happen in
this world that you know nothing about, and
money will do a heap of things.”</p>

<p>“But Henderson has no ten thousand dollars
to give such a man.”</p>

<p>“No, but he would soon get it. I tell you
your father has done right in watching you.”</p>

<p>We all smoked two or three pipes of
tobacco and then Lem said he was getting
sleepy, whereupon we all followed him into
the ranch and went to bed. I don’t suppose
that Bob slumbered a wink that night, but
I slept as soundly as though such men as
Coyote Bill had not been within a hundred<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
miles of us; and yet he came back that same
night and stole the rest of his bedding. A
little further examination showed us that Mr.
Davenport’s favorite riding horse was also
missing, and then we knew that if we ever
caught him again salt would not save him.
The man had been guilty of stealing horses,
and that was enough to hang him. When I
had made these observations I went back to
tell them to Mr. Davenport.</p>

<p>“Of course the man is plucky,” said he,
“and it is going to get him into serious
trouble some day. Now, I want you boys
to come here and sign as witnesses to my
signature. I take my solemn oath that I
wrote this myself,” he added, placing his
forefinger upon his sign manual, “and that
everything in this will is just what I want it
to be. Now, boys, place your own signatures
there. Now, Bob, you sign right there as
witness to their signatures. There, I guess it
is all right. If anything happens to me, get
this pocket-book into your hands as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p>There was one thing that occurred to me<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
right there, although I did not say anything
about it. Mr. Davenport seemed to be thoroughly
convinced that something was going to
happen to him during his ride to Trinity, and
since he knew it, why didn’t he give his
pocket-book up to someone else? That, it
seemed to me, would be the surest way, for
everybody who knew anything about the matter
would know right where the will ought to
be found in case anything “happened” to the
invalid. I thought the matter over while I
was getting ready for breakfast, and concluded
that Bob or somebody else would certainly
see some misfortune on account of that
pocket-book. It stuck close to me, and somehow
I couldn’t get rid of it.</p>

<p>I pass over the next few days, during which
nothing transpired that is worthy of notice.
We did nothing but talk about Coyote Bill,
and wondered where he had gone now and
where we should be likely to meet him again,
for there were none of us who didn’t expect to
see him once more. He wasn’t the man to
give up twenty thousand dollars because one
attempt to secure it had failed. And then<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
what would he say to me? I had been guilty
of treachery to him, and that was a fact.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day, after we
had packed our wagon with water and provisions,
and got all ready for the start, the
cattle from the lower counties made their
appearance. I tell you I never saw so many
head of stock before in my life. They
covered the hills to the right and left as far
as the eye could reach, and as to how deep
they were I don’t know. If a man had all
those cattle in good trim, he would have
nothing to do but sit in his rocking-chair and
sell them. I wondered how many of them
would live to reach Trinity. Not one in ten,
I was satisfied. They flocked into our water-holes,
and in five minutes there wasn’t water
enough left to wet your tongue with. The
strongest fences that could have been made
would not have delayed them a minute.
Presently the leader of the movement appeared
in sight, and came up to the porch
on which we were sitting. His name was
Chisholm, and he seemed the very personification
of good nature. He looked at us boys<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
because he hadn’t seen us before, and greeted
us in his hearty Western fashion.</p>

<p>“How-dy!” said he. “Are you all ready
to start? I hope you’ve got a little mite of
water laid by for us, for we haven’t had a
drink in so long that we don’t know how it
tastes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! we’ve got a drink for you,” said
Mr. Davenport. “Go into that building right
there and you will find two barrels. Fill up
your keg with them.”</p>

<p>“By George! you are the right sort,”
said Mr. Chisholm. “I was afraid some of
our beeves would drink it all up before we got
here and not give us any.”</p>

<p>“Have you lost many cattle coming here?”
asked Mr. Davenport.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, the road is just lined with
them,” answered Mr. Chisholm, getting off
his horse and slipping his bridle over its
head. “If you follow the dead beeves, you
can go straight to my ranch. Nobody ever
heard of such weather as this before. It
doesn’t look like rain in this part of the
country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[90]</span></p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Mr. Davenport. “It has
been dry and hazy every day as long as I can
remember. Do you think we will get up to
Trinity with any beeves?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve got to. It is our only show.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we shall have a fight up
there?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Certain! What would you do if you were
in their place? They think they are in the
right, and we know we are, and the first one
of our cattle that goes down to the water in
Trinity will be tumbled over. I am afraid
that they will outnumber us. The Rangers
and the farmers and the police&mdash;I don’t know.
But our cattle must have water and grass; we
won’t take ‘no’ for an answer.”</p>

<p>“Do you know ’Rastus Johnson?” said
Mr. Davenport suddenly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know him,” said Mr. Chisholm,
looking around. “What of him?”</p>

<p>“He stole my favorite riding horse this
week.”</p>

<p>“Aha! That wasn’t all he did either,” said
Mr. Chisholm, looking hard at the invalid.</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t,” replied Mr. Davenport,<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
who took out the pocket book, told what was
in it, and of the attempt that had been made
to steal it a few nights before. When he
mentioned the name of Coyote Bill Mr. Chisholm
almost jumped from his chair, and so
did the men who had been driving the wagon.
They had obeyed orders and filled up their
empty barrel, took a good drink themselves,
and brought along a cupful for their leader.
Then they sat down and waited until Mr.
Chisholm got ready to start, and listened to
the story.</p>

<p>“Coyote Bill!” said Mr. Chisholm, in dismay.
“I have wanted to find that fellow for
more’n a year, and here I’ve run up against
him two or three times during the last six
months. It is a pity that boy didn’t shoot
him. What were you thinking of?” he
added, turning fiercely upon Elam. “Didn’t
you know that it would put five thousand
dollars in your pocket?”</p>

<p>“No, I never heared of that,” replied
Elam, somewhat startled to find out that he
had had a pull on a man worth that sum of
money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>“Well, the stock-raisers down in our
county would give that much for him any
day. You had a chance to make yourself
rich and then went and threw it away. Dog-gone
such a shot!”</p>

<p>“Look here, friend,” said Elam, straightening
up in his chair and fastening his eyes
upon Mr. Chisholm, “I didn’t shoot him
because I couldn’t; that’s why. What would
you ’a’ done if a man had jumped on you
while you were flat in bed an’ seized the
pistol, an’ turned it t’other way? I done my
best.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you did, but it sounds
kinder funny to me. I wish he would give
me such a shot as that. Where do you think
he is now?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” answered Mr. Davenport.
“He has gone off with that horse, and he certainly
won’t stop until he gets among friends.
I am willing to trust Elam with my life.
There are not many of you can shoot as he
can.”</p>

<p>This went a long way toward cooling the
hot temper of Elam, although I noticed that<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
during the first part of the time we were in
the drive he kept one eye fastened upon Mr.
Chisholm the whole time. He didn’t like the
imputation that had been cast upon his
prowess. If the leader had been in Elam’s
place, and had Coyote Bill’s grasp on his
throat and wrist, he might have been led
to believe that the desperado had plenty of
strength as well as pluck.</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm and his men slept at the
ranch that night, and bright and early the
next morning we were on the move. We
packed up in something of a hurry when we
got fairly ready to go, and I speak of it here
so that you may have no difficulty in understanding
what happened afterward. Not a
single one of the herd was in sight. We followed
along the ground they had passed over,
and it was as bare as your hand. Not a blade
of grass was to be seen. If it had not been
for the grain we had provided for our horses
in the wagons, they would have fared badly,
indeed, and then they didn’t like the grain
any too well. It was only when they were
about half starved that they would touch it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[94]</span></p>

<p>I never knew what starving cattle were
before, for although I had been a week at the
ranch, I had never been out to see what was
going on. The nearest herd was probably
half a day’s journey distant. I stayed in the
ranch with Mr. Davenport almost all the time.
I had not seen the walking skeletons which were
now shambling before us, but now I saw them
all too plainly. Every once in a little while
we would come across some stricken animal
who had laid down, and was waiting for death
to come. And it was so all along our route.
Whichever way you turned your eyes you
were sure to see some dead cattle.</p>

<p>“I’ll just tell you what’s a fact, Mr. Davenport,”
said I, after counting thirteen dead
animals, who could not go any further. “If
we keep on losing cattle at this rate we’ll
have to go at something else when we get up
to Trinity. There will be no need for the
Rangers and farmers to gather up there, for
we shan’t have many animals to shoot.”</p>

<p>“It looks that way to me, I confess,” said
the man, looking down at the horn of his
saddle. “But you know what Mr. Chisholm<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
said. We must go on; it’s our only
show.”</p>

<p>For three weeks we were in the drive (the
journey could have been made in one week if
the cattle had been in trim), seeing nothing
new&mdash;nothing but dead animals and a prairie
that looked as hard as the road. During all
this time there was a little party of us that
were kept in a state of suspense, and it was
all the more painful to us because we could
not say anything about it. Mr. Davenport
was failing rapidly; anybody could see that,
and now and then some cowboy looked pityingly
at Bob. And Bob knew it all the
while, and took pains to keep it from his
father, and from us, too. He would joke and
laugh with him all day, and when night came
would roll over and cry himself to sleep. No
son ever tried harder to make a parent’s last
days happy.</p>

<p>“I tell you I’d like to see that Clifford Henderson
about now,” said Tom Mason. “That
boy has cried himself to sleep again. Bob
hasn’t got anything here anyway, and I’d
like to see somebody come up and take away<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
his last cent from him. He shouldn’t get
away with it.”</p>

<p>Things went on in this way until the
wooded shores of Trinity were in plain sight,
and that brown-whiskered farmer came out in
company with a deputy sheriff to hold a consultation
with Mr. Chisholm&mdash;“the boss,” he
called him. You all know what that “consultation”
amounted to. It was defiance on
one side and threats to have our cattle shot on
the other. That brown-whiskered man must
have been crazy, if he thought that our small
force of sixty men could turn those beeves
back when they had got “a sniff of that
water” that was flashing along on the other
side of the willows, for they were already
bearing down upon it with the irresistible
power of an avalanche. All the cowboys in
the State could not have turned them from
their purpose. I looked at Mr. Davenport to
see what he thought about it.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, this begins to look like war,”
said he, with an attempt at a smile. He was
very pale, but he clutched his rifle with the
hand of one who had made up his mind to die<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
right there. “Two hundred against sixty is
big odds, but we must face the music. Our
cattle must have water, or we shall lose more
than half we’ve got left before morning. Go
and water your horses, and then come back
and see if you can’t arouse some of these
beeves. If you can only induce them to go
ahead a mile further they will have water
enough.”</p>

<p>“You will remain close by the wagon?”
enquired Bob.</p>

<p>“I will stay right here,” returned his
father. “When you want me come right
back to the wagon.”</p>

<p>The events of the next quarter of an hour
proved one of two things: either that the
farmers, when they saw the immense herd
approaching their ambush, realized how
utterly impossible it was to stop them, and
that the attempt to do so would only result in
a useless waste of life, or else that the sheriff,
acting upon Mr. Chisholm’s advice, had prevailed
upon them to fall back and give the
famishing cattle a chance at the water. At
any rate, to Bob’s great relief, the shot for<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
which he was waiting and listening was not
fired, and the cattle dashed through the willows
and almost buried themselves in the
stream. When Bob and his friends reached
the bank,&mdash;and they were obliged to ride at
least a mile up the bayou before they could
find a place to water their horses,&mdash;the stream
being literally filled with the thirsty beeves,&mdash;they
saw the farmers gathered in a body
five hundred yards away, and Mr. Chisholm
and some of the other wealthy cattle-owners
were talking to them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">MR. DAVENPORT’S POCKET-BOOK.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">“It is too late for them to begin a fight
now,” said Bob, with a long-drawn sigh
of satisfaction. “Here’s water enough in
abundance and grass enough to last the stock
for a day or two; but where shall we go and
what shall we do after that? Who are those
over there? More farmers, I suppose, for if
they were cattlemen they would not come
from that direction.”</p>

<p>As Bob said this he directed our attention
to a long line of horsemen, who, moving in a
compact body, were rapidly approaching the
place on which the farmers stood. They
moved four abreast and didn’t scatter out
enough from the ranks to be farmers, and
therefore I knew them to be something else.</p>

<p>“They are soldiers,” I said.</p>

<p>“Texas Rangers!” exclaimed Bob. “I am
glad to see them, for they won’t let us fight,<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
anyway. Their object is to preserve order on
the frontier, and they will arrest anybody
who doesn’t obey them. Let’s wait a few
minutes and see what they are going to do.”</p>

<p>We waited, and in a short time saw that
the farmers were not as glad to see them as
we were. The column halted and the three
officers in command rode up to see what the
trouble was about, and in two minutes were
surrounded by a wall of clenched fists, which
were flourished in the air. The farmers
seemed bent on telling their story before the
cattlemen could get in a word, but presently
we heard a loud voice commanding silence,
and after that everything became as quiet as
could be. One man had been called upon to
tell what he knew, and the others consented
to wait until he got through.</p>

<p>“I guess there won’t be any fighting as long
as the Rangers are here, and so we will go
back and see to the cattle,” said I. “We’re
going to have a hard time in getting them
over the hill, so that they can see the water,
but if we can do that for even one it will be
just so much money saved.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<p>If anybody has tried to get cattle up when
once they have laid down and abandoned
themselves to their fate, he will know what a
time we had of it. Whips didn’t do any
good. The only thing we could do was to use
our lariats upon them and fairly drag them to
their feet. In this way, by taking two boys
to each cow, we managed to get half a dozen
of them to the top of the hill, where they
could see their companions, and by that time
it was pitch dark. We didn’t know whose
cows they were, and that made no difference.
We saw several other men engaged as we were,
and when the last squad of them came along
we joined them and rode toward the wagon.</p>

<p>“Let the balance go,” said one of the cowboys.
“If the cool night air of the prairie
don’t revive them nothing else will. I believe
I would like to have a drink of water
myself.”</p>

<p>“We got along without a fight, didn’t
we?” said Bob, who seemed to know everybody
on the plains.</p>

<p>“Of course; but it looked pretty blue for a
while, I tell you. The farmers can’t begin a<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
fight now, anyway. They ought to have
pitched into us the moment we came in
sight.”</p>

<p>“Does anybody know where our wagon
is?” I enquired.</p>

<p>Nobody did. They were on the hunt for
their own wagons themselves, and the only
thing they could do was to keep on going
until they found them. That seemed to be
the only thing for us to do, too, so we rode
down to the willows, and every time we saw a
team we sent one of our number in to make
enquiries. When it came my turn I went in
and found only two men, who were engaged
in getting their supper.</p>

<p>“That’s Mr. Davenport’s wagon up there in
the bend,” said one, pointing up the river.
“Do you belong?”</p>

<p>I replied that I did belong there, and that I
was somewhat anxious to find it, for I was
in need of something to eat.</p>

<p>“I hope you aint any relative of the man
who owns it,” said the cowboy. “If you are
you will find him as dead as a smoked
herring.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[103]</span></p>

<p>These words were all I wanted to hear. A
queer pang shot over me when I thought of
Bob. How was I to break the news to him?</p>

<p>“Why, how did anybody find it out?” I
managed to say at last.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s there! They found him breathing
his last on the plains, and brought him in.
Say, do you know what hold Chisholm has
got on him? He has got a guard over him,
and won’t let nobody go nigh him.”</p>

<p>“It ’pears to me that he’s got some documents
on him that he does not want to give
up,” said the other cowboy. “If you belong
there, why, of course, you will know all
about it.”</p>

<p>I never had anything come quite so hard as
I did in riding back through those willows to
the place where Bob sat on his horse, for I
didn’t know how in the world I could tell him
of his father’s death; but when I got within
sight of him I found that Mr. Chisholm was
ahead of me. When he found that Bob
didn’t come in with the rest of the cowboys
he had come out to find him, believing that
he could tell him better than anybody else. I<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
saw that he had been very easy about it, but
it was all Bob could do to stand it. Elam
Storm was his friend. He did not go to anyone
else, but rose up close to him and threw
both his arms around his neck.</p>

<p>“Oh, Elam! you’re the only friend I’ve got
now,” said Bob, striving hard to keep back
his sobs.</p>

<p>Elam stammered and coughed, and looked
all around for help. Finally he glanced appealingly
at me, but what could I say?</p>

<p>“He was brung in about half an hour ago,”
said Mr. Chisholm, drawing his hand hastily
across his face. “And although we have had
two doctors at him, whom we found among the
Rangers, they say it is too late to do anything.
They say it is something like heart disease.”</p>

<p>“Was no one near him when he was
taken?” I asked, feeling that I must say
something.</p>

<p>“There were a dozen men near him,” was
the answer. “They got to him as quickly as
they could, but couldn’t be of any use. And
I’ll tell you that he had his left hand tightly
clasped on his pocket-book,” said Mr. Chisholm,<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
riding up closer to me and speaking in
a whisper. “So that is safe.”</p>

<p>I breathed easier after that, and fell in
beside Mr. Chisholm, who led the way slowly
toward the wagon. We found it completely
surrounded by men&mdash;Rangers, farmers, and
cowboys&mdash;who had come in to see about it;
for it was seldom that a loss like this happened
during a drive. But they paid no
attention to us. Their gaze was fixed upon a
man who had attempted to go into the wagon,
but the guard had stopped him. We worked
our way gradually through the crowd, and
Bob, who gave little heed to what was going
on around him, threw himself from his horse,
and made his way into the wagon.</p>

<p>“Elam,” said he, “you must go with me.
I feel safer when you are around.”</p>

<p>The guard, prompted by a sign from Mr.
Chisholm, allowed him to pass, and nobody
made any effort to stop him, but the man who
was talking with the guard was well-nigh
furious.</p>

<p>“Who’s that who allows a stranger to go
in to my brother?” said he, turning fiercely<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
upon Mr. Chisholm. “I guess I have got
more right in there than he has.”</p>

<p>“Who be you?” asked Mr. Chisholm.</p>

<p>“I am Clifford Henderson, if it will do you
any good to know it,” answered the man. “I
haven’t seen my brother for eight years, and I
claim the right to go in to him.”</p>

<p>“That’s nothing more than fair, Aleck,”
said one of the cowboys. “He has as good a
right to see him as anybody.”</p>

<p>So that was Clifford Henderson, was it?
Mr. Chisholm turned and gave him a good
looking over, and Tom Mason and I did the
same; and I was forced to make the confession
that, as far as resemblance went, Bob was
a long way off. Henderson was the very picture
of the dead and gone Mr. Davenport. He
was a man of rather large size, dressed like the
Texans that stood around him; and, if he had
allowed his whiskers to grow into a goatee,
instead of that flowing beard, he could easily
have passed himself off for his brother. I am
free to say that I didn’t know enough about
law to know which way the property would
turn, but then what did these men care about<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
law? Bob’s father’s signature, backed up by
the names of all of us, and witnessed by Bob
himself, would bring him the legal right to
everything he owned. But there was one
thing against Henderson: He got mad when
he was told that he could not see his brother.
Mr. Chisholm evidently noticed this and resolved
to profit by it.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, you are as like your brother as
two peas,” said Mr. Chisholm, at length.</p>

<p>“I know I am,” said Henderson, taking off
his hat and turning around so that everybody
could see him. “I haven’t seen him in a
long time, and I demand the right to see him
now.”</p>

<p>“All right! You shall have it,” said Mr.
Chisholm, and riding up close to the wagon
he called out: “Bob, have you got that
pocket-book?”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” exclaimed Henderson. “That
pocket-book is just what I want. There are
some papers in it that relate to me.”</p>

<p>“Hand it out here,” said Mr. Chisholm, as
Elam answered in the affirmative from the
wagon; and when his hands closed upon the<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
pocket-book, he put it into his inside coat.</p>

<p>“Now you can see your brother as soon as
you please.”</p>

<p>“But I want that thing you put inside of
your coat,” said Mr. Henderson, and I didn’t
blame him for showing anger. “All my
future depends on what you have there.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have some supper first; after that
you can all come here and we’ll listen to
the different tales this book has got to
tell.”</p>

<p>“Different tales?” ejaculated Henderson.
“There’s only one tale it can tell, and that is,
that all his property belongs to me. Who is
that stranger whom you allowed to go inside
the wagon? I want him out of there when I
go in.”</p>

<p>“Bob!” shouted Mr. Chisholm; “have you
got through in there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” sobbed Bob.</p>

<p>“Why, a person would think that the dead
man was some relative of his!” said Henderson,
in surprise. “To tell you the truth, I
never saw the boy before.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, come out,” said Mr. Chisholm.<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
“Be careful to look in all his pockets
to see that you don’t miss anything.”</p>

<p>Elam and Bob came out in obedience to Mr.
Chisholm’s instructions, and it was plain to
everybody standing around that there was
no sham about their feelings. Elam’s face
looked as long as your arm, while Bob had
evidently been crying, and I took notice of
the fact that it had an effect upon the men
standing around. Of course there were two
sides to the question. Some were in favor of
Bob, while others believed that Henderson had
the right on his side; and still others were
willing to wait until the matter had been thoroughly
investigated before they inclined to
either side. It was a big jury of four hundred
men, and somehow I didn’t feel at all
uneasy.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, you are at liberty to go in as
soon as you please,” said Mr. Chisholm,
waving his hand toward the wagon.</p>

<p>“Yes; and thanks to you these strangers
have got everything they wanted,” returned
Henderson angrily.</p>

<p>“Look a-here, pardner, I am in favor of<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
doing whatever is right,” said our leader,
throwing more emphasis into his words than I
had seen him use before. “This pocket-book
has two tales to tell. If they speak in your
benefit you shall have it. Tony, catch up!
Boys, I am going to eat supper with you
to-night.”</p>

<p>Henderson went into the wagon, the men
turned away to hunt their own wagons and
get a bite to eat, and Tony began his preparations
for supper. Mr. Chisholm sat down on a
little mound of grass, rested his hands upon
his knees, and looked thoughtfully at the
ground; we boys stood around waiting impatiently
for him to speak, and all watched for
Henderson to come out of the wagon. He
was gone a long time, and during his stay in
there he threw everything about in the
greatest confusion. He didn’t leave a single
thing the way he found it, and he was in so
great a hurry to find something of which he
was in search that our fellows had to go to
work and straighten up things. I knew he
wasn’t making any friends by his unceremonious
conduct. He at length appeared,<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
and, if his looks indicated anything, he was
madder than he was when he went in.</p>

<p>“Things have come to a pretty pass, I must
confess,” said he, and he was almost boiling
over with fury. “I must wait the pleasure
of strangers, till they get ready to let me have
my brother’s things! What kind of a law do
you call that?”</p>

<p>“It’s the law in this State, whatever it may
be elsewhere,” said Mr. Chisholm.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I never saw this boy
before,” continued Henderson. “He is some
little upstart that my brother has seen since
he came to Texas. He wouldn’t have adopted
anything like him, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Why, Clifford Henderson, I know you,”
said Bob. “I remember when I used to see
you in St. Louis&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You never saw me before in your life,”
returned Henderson, with a scowl on his forehead
that might have made Bob tremble if
he had been alone. “And I never saw you
before.”</p>

<p>“Easy, easy!” exclaimed Mr. Chisholm
soothingly. “It will all come out when we<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
have had our supper. Until then just rest in
peace.”</p>

<p>Henderson started off with the air of a man
who would have snatched things bald-headed
if he had only possessed the opportunity, and
when he was well out of hearing Mr. Chisholm
continued:</p>

<p>“Bob, you want to keep mum and answer
such questions as I shall ask you by and by.
These boys have all signed the will in your
favor? Well, that’s enough. Let’s see him
get around that.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t help thinking that he has
got something back of it,” said Bob, between
his sobs. “He goes about it so confidently
that I am really afraid of him. He
denies that he ever saw me.”</p>

<p>“Of course. That’s to be expected. But
you are sure that you have seen him before?”</p>

<p>“Why, I knew him the minute I put my
eyes on him,” said Bob, looking up. “He
was always the very picture of my father,
and if father had wanted his property to go to
him he would have said so. He would have
told you so, Mr. Chisholm, while you were<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
sitting on the porch listening to his story.
He would have told these boys so while he was
telling them the history of the pocket-book.”</p>

<p>“Well, take it easy. Things will come out
all right in the end.”</p>

<p>There was silence around that camp fire
while we were eating supper, until Frank,
the cowboy, came in and sauntered up for his
share of it. He was evidently big with news,
for when he had helped himself to a plateful
and began looking around for a place to sit
down, he said:</p>

<p>“Henderson’s got something that didn’t
belong to him. He’s been searching that body.
He has got a hundred dollars in cash.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?” exclaimed Mr.
Chisholm.</p>

<p>“I say, he’s got a hundred dollars in cash
that he is going to put in his pocket and keep
there. He says he found it in the wagon,
and don’t mean to let anybody take it
away from him.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that,” said Mr. Chisholm.
“The money has got to go where the pocket-book
goes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<p>After that there was more silence until we
had all finished our suppers, and got our
pipes out, and then the men began to stroll in
one after the other. I noticed, too, that almost
all the cowboys, some of the farmers, and a
good many of the Rangers appeared to side
with Mr. Chisholm, for they took particular
pains to place themselves pretty close to him.
Henderson was one of the first to appear, and
when he seated himself on a log opposite our
leader, he must have been surprised at the
meagre showing he had.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” said Mr. Chisholm, knocking
the ashes from his pipe, “we are all here, are
we? If you know of anybody that’s back
send ’em on, for we want this thing done up in
order. I’ll appoint you all as jurymen, and
we’ll show some people out there in the settlements
that we can do some things as well as
they can. The first thing that is done when a
man dies is to read his will; but first I must
have every article that belongs to him. You
know it all goes where the will goes, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>Of course that was settled. All the boys<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
standing around agreed to that. But Mr.
Chisholm wasn’t satisfied. He put it to a
vote, and such a sonorous “Aye!” as resounded
through that grove of willows was
never heard there before.</p>

<p>“I have no business to act as judge, but I
know a story which may fit well into the
case,” Mr. Chisholm hastened to explain,
“and consequently I shall put everything to
a vote. It’s settled, then, that I must have
every article that belongs to Mr. Davenport.
Henderson, I’ll thank you to hand over that
hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“What hundred dollars?” enquired the
man; but a person could see that he was
slightly uneasy. He did not like Mr. Chisholm’s
way of talking.</p>

<p>“The hundred dollars you got while you
were in the wagon,” returned Mr. Chisholm.
“You done something when you were in the
wagon that you had no business to do. You
searched the body.”</p>

<p>“Well, I did it because I thought he had
some papers about him that I had more business
with than anybody else,” said Henderson;<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
and when he uttered the words he looked at
Mr. Chisholm as if to ask him what he was
going to do about it. “I knew I couldn’t get
them while a stranger was about.”</p>

<p>The man must have been crazy to talk this
way in the presence of four hundred men who
were assembled as a jury to try his rights of
property. He was making enemies fast. I
knew that around his camp fire he had talked
to fellows who were gathered there until he
had brought them to his own way of thinking;
but they didn’t suppose that he was going to
act the dunce at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>“You say you won’t hand them out?” enquired
Mr. Chisholm, and anybody could see
that he was getting mad.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t! The money is mine!”</p>

<p>“Hand ’em out here!” roared Mr. Chisholm.</p>

<p>“I tell you I won’t do it. It belongs to
me!”</p>

<p>Our leader was a man who would not take
this for an answer. He slowly and deliberately
arose to his feet, the cowboys, especially
his own and Mr. Davenport’s, drawing
nearer to him, and when he got up the shining<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
barrel of a six-shooter was looking Henderson
squarely in the face. The man turned pale
and stepped back. He gazed around at the
cowboys, but none seemed ready to help him.
On the contrary, they all folded their arms,
and that was as good a sign as he wanted.</p>

<p>“What kind of a law do you call this?”
said Henderson, putting his hand into his
pocket. “If I had a pack of Comanches to
decide for me I would stand just as much
show.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is the law here, and you are a fool
for bucking against it,” said Mr. Chisholm, as
the money was placed in his hands. It was
a large pile of money to contain one hundred
dollars, and I was glad to see that he
spoke about it. “Judging by the contents
of your pocket you got rather more than a
hundred dollars while you were about it,” he
added, with a smile. “So far so good! Now
the next thing is the reading of the will.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm, who was the coolest man I
ever saw to pass through such an ordeal,
seated himself on the grass hummock again,
and produced the pocket-book from inside<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
his coat. He opened it and laid it upon his
knee, and of course we all strained our necks
to get a glimpse of it. The first thing that
came into view was a little pile of letters,
all endorsed, and confined by a rubber band
such as business men use to keep their correspondence
in one place. Mr. Chisholm
pulled the topmost one out and looked at it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">TOM HAS AN IDEA.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">“The first thing I have struck here is a
receipt for $23.40 paid to Lemuel Bailley,
dated October 23, 18&mdash;. Why, that’s a
long time before the drought came,” said Mr.
Chisholm, looking up. “Is Bailley here?”</p>

<p>“Here, sir,” responded Bailley, who was
one of Mr. Davenport’s cowboys. “I remember
of giving Mr. Davenport that receipt. I
wanted it to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go on a spree with,” interrupted Mr.
Chisholm. “Well, you got it, didn’t you?
The next is also a receipt. And so is the next
one, and the next one. In fact I don’t see
anything but receipts here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm continued to call out the
names of the payees of the receipts, some containing
money paid to the cowboys, some
relating to supplies of various kinds purchased
at the store, handing each one to<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
some man who stood near him to see if he
was right, until he had but few papers left in
the bundle. The longer he read the more
astonished he became, until finally he turned
the pocket-book upside down to show that it
was empty.</p>

<p>“That’s all,” said he. “There is nothing
but receipts in it. What is your pleasure
with the pocket-book? Shall it go to this
man who has not grieved any over Mr. Davenport’s
death&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t want it,” said Henderson, who
was paler now than when he was looking into
Mr. Chisholm’s six-shooter. “The pocket-book
I wanted contains papers that relate to
me. I have nothing whatever to do with the
receipts.”</p>

<p>“Or shall it go to the boy who has done
nothing but mourn for him ever since he was
brought in?” said Mr. Chisholm, paying no
heed to the interruption. “Of course the
money goes with it.”</p>

<p>“Now you’re talking,” said Henderson,
brightening a little. “Give me the money
and let this boy have the pocket-book. It’s<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
mine, and I don’t see why you should want to
keep it from me.”</p>

<p>“And you say you never saw this boy
before?” said Mr. Chisholm.</p>

<p>“Never in my life,” returned Henderson.
“When I saw that boy come by me and go
into the wagon I was dumfounded.”</p>

<p>“Bob, you say you have seen this man
before?”</p>

<p>“I used to see him every day in St. Louis,”
replied Bob, who was very much cast down.
“He used to live at our house.”</p>

<p>“He is very much mistaken. He never
saw me. I have never been in St. Louis in
my life.”</p>

<p>“Seeing that Henderson is next of kin,”
said one of the farmers, stepping forward, “I
think the money ought to go to him.”</p>

<p>“And the pocket-book to Bob?” added
Mr. Chisholm.</p>

<p>“Why, in course. I think so.”</p>

<p>“Is that in form of a resolution?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes.”</p>

<p>“Can I get a second to it?”</p>

<p>The answer that came up from four hundred<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
throats was enough to show Bob that all
his hopes of winning the money was gone,
even before the motion was put; but put it
was, and it was carried unanimously.</p>

<p>“Now all opposed say ‘No’!” said Mr.
Chisholm.</p>

<p>There was no one at all who answered.
Those who didn’t vote wanted to think the
matter over before giving their decision. Mr.
Chisholm had placed his hand in his pocket
and brought out the roll of bills, which he
gave to Henderson, and at the same time he
laid the pocket-book on Bob’s knee. The
latter’s hands closed about it as though it had
contained the will he had expected to find
there. He didn’t care a cent for the money&mdash;he
would have given it all to have his father
back to him, but the pocket-book was something
that Mr. Davenport had handled. He
would cherish it as long as he lived.</p>

<p>“There’s somebody in camp who has removed
that pocket-book that I wanted to
see,” said Henderson, as he clutched the bills
and thrust them into his pocket. “I know
my brother well enough to understand his<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
business, and when he saw his end coming he
didn’t let the matter drop here. He has got a
will somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Lem! Frank!” shouted Mr. Chisholm.</p>

<p>The two cowboys instantly stepped forward.</p>

<p>“You were the first to get to Mr. Davenport
when he fell off his horse?” continued
our leader.</p>

<p>“We were,” answered the two cowboys, in
concert.</p>

<p>“Did you watch carefully to see that nobody
else touched him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, we did. We knew he had that
pocket-book.”</p>

<p>“Was the guard that was placed over him
a reliable person?”</p>

<p>“There’s none better. Mebbe you’ll say
we took it!” said Frank, seeing that Henderson
gazed at him with a smile of disbelief on
his face. “You say that once an’ you won’t
say it again!”</p>

<p>“I am not saying anybody took it,”
said Henderson. “I am simply saying that
it is gone. Anybody can say that, I suppose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; but you say what you had on your
mind an’ see how you will come out! We
know a story worth a dozen of yours.”</p>

<p>“Easy, easy!” said Mr. Chisholm, catching
Frank by the arm. “This matter is settled
for the time being. Now we will go to bed
and sleep on it. Maybe it will look different
to us in the morning.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm filled his pipe with great
deliberation, and the four hundred men who
had stood around to settle the case, taking it
for granted that the court had adjourned until
more evidence could be obtained, strolled off
to their own camps. I was glad to see that
very few of them went with Henderson. Although
they had decided in his favor, giving
him the money and Bob the receipts, somehow
they didn’t feel right about it. But the
question was, where was the will?</p>

<p>“Of all the mean, sneaking courts that ever
I heard of&mdash;&mdash;” began Frank.</p>

<p>“Now, Frank, that will do,” said Lem,
taking him by the arm and leading him away.
“I know what you want to say, and whenever
you get to talkin’ you let out some swear<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
words that don’t sound well. Mr. Chisholm
is bossin’ this thing.”</p>

<p>“But he never asked us to tell our story,”
continued Frank. “We uns could have
knocked that fellow’s case higher than the
moon.”</p>

<p>“An’ he never told his own,” said Elam.</p>

<p>“What good would it have done to tell
everything we knew when there was no will
to back it up?” said Mr. Chisholm, throwing
back a brand upon the fire with which he had
lighted his pipe. “When we get the will
we’ll talk to him. Bob, did you ever know
your father to have two pocket-books like the
one you have got in your clothes?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I never saw him have but the
one,” said Bob, taking out the pocket-book and
looking at it. “The man has got everything
father owned. But, believe me, I don’t care
for that. I am young and can easily make a
living.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm drew his hand hastily across
his eyes, as I had seen him do before, and
started off for his own camp, while the rest of
us sat down to think the matter over. I never<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
saw men and boys so completely done up as
we were, who were sitting around that fire,
and I will venture to say that Bob thought
less about the money than we did. He had
been brought up in the belief that it was all
his own, and now he had lost it. I tell you I
felt sorry for him. He sat gazing into the fire
for a short time, then spoke a few words to
Elam, who went off and returned with his
blankets. He made up a bed under the
wagon and laid down there with Bob. Tom
Mason was the second one who was badly perplexed.
He would gaze steadily into the fire,
as if he there hoped to find a solution to some
problem he was working out in his mind, and
then at me, moving his lips, as he always did
when anything troubled him, and finally he
arose and gave me a nod, which I readily
understood. I followed him through the
willows, and finally stood on the edge of the
prairie, where the cattle, having got their fill
of the water, were lying down. There were
no sentries out to-night. A stampede was the
last thing we had to fear.</p>

<p>“Say, Carlos, did you hear what Mr. Chisholm<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
had to say to Bob about his father having
another pocket-book like the one he had in
his clothes?” he whispered, after looking all
around to make sure that there was no one
within hearing. “Now, it has just occurred
to me that perhaps there is another one, and
that Mr. Davenport put it into his pocket.”</p>

<p>“But Bob says there isn’t any other,” said
I, jumping at the conclusion. That very
same thing had been running in my own
mind, and I was anxious to hear what Tom
thought about it. “It looks like the pocket-book
that he slammed in his hands when he
told us his story.”</p>

<p>“That may be; but I tell you he has got
another,” said Tom earnestly. “The other
one is hidden somewhere about the house.”</p>

<p>“I wish I was as certain of it as you are,”
said I.</p>

<p>“Well, now, the only way we can find out
is to go there and give everything a good
overhauling, when there is nobody there to
prevent us,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Don’t you suppose that Henderson has
thought of that already?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[128]</span></p>

<p>“Let him. Who cares? We will go there
and give things another examination after he
has left. I tell you, Carlos, it is our only
chance,” insisted Tom. “And with that
pocket-book in our hands we can carry the
day, I bet you.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to go without letting anybody
know it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Henderson will wake up and
find Bob here, and that is all he cares for. I
don’t suppose he has taken a single glance at
us. Will you go?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to see Mr. Chisholm first.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. I don’t imagine that our horses
can stand the trip&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They’ve got to stand it,” said I, for Tom
was so anxious about the matter that I began
to feel some of his enthusiasm. “If Mr.
Chisholm thinks it safe I will go. But, Tom,
we have men to deal with who are just as cunning
as we are. I’ll bet you that we find that
ranch overhauled when we get there.”</p>

<p>“They can’t travel faster than we can,”
said Tom confidently.</p>

<p>“Yes, they can. They are working for<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
money now, and they will travel night and
day.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go and see Mr. Chisholm.
We can’t do anything as long as we stand
talking here. I don’t know where his camp
is; do you?”</p>

<p>No, I didn’t know where the camp was, but
that made no difference to me. The only way
I could find it was to look for it, and that I
proceeded to do, leaving Tom outside on the
prairie. We walked along the edge of the
willows until we saw a light shining through
them, and then I walked in. It proved to be
Mr. Chisholm’s camp. There were a dozen
men standing around in little groups talking
about the incidents of Mr. Davenport’s death,
and a little apart from all of them sat Mr.
Chisholm, smoking, as usual.</p>

<p>“I guess Henderson didn’t feel very good
over the decision we reached, giving him the
money and Bob the receipts,” said one of the
men. “Five hundred dollars is what he got,
and that aint nothing to him. Where did he
come from, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“He’s a speculator,” said another. “He<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
don’t do anything, but just buys and sells
cattle. He’s got a nice little thing in having
Mr. Davenport’s cattle, if they were only in
good trim.”</p>

<p>“But that aint what he wants,” said a
third. “Mr. Davenport has got some money
somewhere in some bank or another, and he
wants authority to draw it out.”</p>

<p>That was all I wanted to hear, so I stepped
up to Mr. Chisholm and gave him a friendly
nudge. Then I walked off to the place where
I had left Tom Mason, and he followed along
after me. I could see that he was very much
depressed, so after he had gone a short distance
out of hearing of the men who stood at
the fire, I said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Chisholm, Tom Mason thinks there is
another pocket book.”</p>

<p>“There now,” said he, and he stopped as
suddenly as though I had aimed a blow at
him. “That thing has been running in my
head, too. But what made Tom think of it?”</p>

<p>“Here he is, and he can explain the matter
for himself,” I answered. “Now, Tom, give
it to Mr. Chisholm just as you gave it to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[131]</span></p>

<p>It did not take Tom long to do that. Tom
was a good talker when he had anything on
his mind, and he had Mr. Chisholm with him
from the start. The man listened intently
until he got through, and then gave Tom a
slap on the back that I thought would have
driven him into the ground.</p>

<p>“Them’s the very points that I have been
running over in my own head ever since the
court adjourned,” said he gleefully. “Now,
how are you going to work it? Do you
intend to go off without letting anybody know
it? Remember that you have got some men
to deal with that are just as smart as you are.
There’s something about that Henderson that
I don’t like any too well.”</p>

<p>“That is just what we intend to do,”
replied Tom. “From some things I have
heard of the man I don’t like him too well
myself, and we can get to the house and give
the things a thorough overhauling before he
gets there. If we can find the pocket-book
we’ll come back and tell you of it, and all you
will have to do will be to go to that bank and
stop the money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>

<p>“But I don’t know where the bank is,”
said Mr. Chisholm. “That’s what’s bothering
of me now. It may be some bank in St.
Louis.”</p>

<p>That was a set-back that Tom hadn’t
thought of. He looked at me and then
looked down at the ground.</p>

<p>“Never mind. You go on up to the house
and search high and low for that pocket-book.
Don’t leave a stone unturned that one
can hide a pocket-book under, and when you
get through come back and tell me what luck
you have had. I guess if anybody can find it
you can.”</p>

<p>“I think so too, Mr. Chisholm,” said I.
“Tom’s the luckiest fellow I ever saw. He
found the nugget when we had almost given
up the search.”</p>

<p>“The nugget?” repeated Mr. Chisholm.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; the one that Elam Storm lost
fourteen years ago. He knew it was around
there somewhere, but no one could tell him
where it was. Tom in poking around and following
what he considered to be a blind trail,
stumbled onto it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[133]</span></p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t hear anything about
that,” said Mr. Chisholm, casting a glance of
admiration upon Tom. “Was there much
into it?”</p>

<p>“It was as big as he could lift,” I replied.
“Elam has got the most of it in a belt under
his clothes. We came here to buy cattle, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must hear all about that some
day. Now you go and hunt for that pocket-book,
and don’t you come back without it.
Take plenty of grub along so that you will
have something to eat, for if you don’t you
will be up a stump. Good-by, and good luck
to you!”</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm turned about and walked into
the willows, and Tom and I stood and looked
at each other. He had wished us good luck
the same as if we were going on a day’s journey,
and yet it would take us a week to go
back to the ranch, and another week to get
back to camp, to say nothing of the difficulties
we would meet on the way. I didn’t mind it
in the least, but I saw that Tom didn’t know
what to think about it. When he got into a<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
place that he could not think his way out of,
he turned to me.</p>

<p>“Is that all he has to say to us?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“What more do you want?” I enquired.
“He has bid us good-by and told us to take
plenty of provisions along, and that’s about
all he can do. Now, Tom, can you saddle
our horses without arousing anybody? If
you can, I will go to the wagon and get
some grub.”</p>

<p>Yes, Tom could do that, and he started off
at once to carry out his part of the programme.
The horses were hitched in the
outer edge of the willows, and consequently
he had nothing to do but to make two trips
to the fire after our saddles and weapons;
while I had to work in the presence of everybody,
and there were two men around our
camp fire that I did not want to know anything
about it. They may have been all
right, but Mr. Davenport had not taken them
into his confidence and that made me suspicious
of them. When I got within reach of
the circle of light thrown out by our camp<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
fire I moved with cautious footsteps, for Elam
and Bob were sleeping under the wagon, and
threw aside the canvas covering before I
stepped in. Merciful Heavens, what a sight
there was presented to my gaze! Everything
in the wagon had been pawed over, and furthermore,
some of the things had been thrown
upon the body of Mr. Davenport. It was
some of that Henderson’s work, and showed
how badly he felt over the death of his
brother! If I had been in the humor to do it
I could have had some shooting done in that
camp inside of five minutes, but instead of
that I sprang into the wagon and removed
the articles of desecration, and placed the
blanket evenly over the figure as it was
before.</p>

<p>“This is one thing I shall always blame
myself for,” said I, under my breath. “I
ought to have brought Mr. Chisholm here
at once, and showed him what that man is
capable of doing. I believe I could have
turned the tables in short order without the
long ride that is before me.”</p>

<p>So filled with rage that I could hardly see,<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
I proceeded to select the grub that was to do
Tom and me during our ride to Mr. Davenport’s
ranch and back: two slices of bacon
and a bag to put them in, some meal, and a
little salt. That was all we took with us. I
lowered them to the ground and was about
to follow them, when I saw that Frank was
awake and looking at me. Placing my finger
upon my lips I walked over and talked to him.</p>

<p>“Where are you fellows going?” he asked,
in his ordinary tone of voice. “One would
think you were going to skip the camp.”</p>

<p>“And so we are,” I replied, in a whisper.
“Tom Mason and I are going after the missing
pocket-book.”</p>

<p>“Carlos,” said he, in the same cautious
whisper, “your head is level. I tell you that
man has a pocket-book&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know he has, and we are going after it,”
said I, anxious to bring the interview to a
close as soon as possible. “If we are missed
don’t you say one word. I say, Frank, that
Henderson is a mighty mean chap. When he
went into the wagon looking for the pocket-book
he threw the things all about. He<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
didn’t even take pains to see that they went
on the floor, either.”</p>

<p>“The blamed skunk!” said Frank, raising
himself on his elbow. “You don’t mean to
say that he threw them on&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. He threw them all over him.
But it is too late to remedy the matter now.
I put them off where they belong, and I only
tell you this so that you can make him shut
his mouth if he begins working his chin too
much to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Dog-gone you! why didn’t you tell me
before you touched the things? I would have
made him take them off himself. Well, good
luck to you! Look everywhere for that
pocket-book.”</p>

<p>If Tom had been there he wouldn’t have
found any fault with Frank’s parting, for he
threw into his grip all the strength that a
strong man could. After I had received the
assurance that he wouldn’t notice our absence
on the morrow, I gathered up the provisions
and started for the prairie. Tom was already
there, and he was holding by the bridle the
two horses which he had saddled, and our<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
weapons laid beside him on the ground.
When I told him what work Henderson
had made in the wagon he was utterly
dumfounded.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell somebody of it?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Because I put the things back where they
belong,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Well, you ought not to have done it.
That would have made me mad enough for
anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, keep still, and let us mount our
horses and go on. You can say more about it
when we get further away.”</p>

<p>By this time I had given him some of the
provisions, which I saw him fasten behind his
saddle. I did the same with the others, and
when I had gathered up my weapons we
mounted and rode away into the darkness. I
was satisfied that no one but Mr. Chisholm
and Frank knew of our absence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">TOM’S LUCK.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">It was just such a night as you would take
if you wanted to go a-fishing. The moon
shone down on us through a thick haze, such
as we had seen many a night since our arrival
on the prairie, and every little sound that
broke the stillness could be heard a long way
off. We could distinctly hear the Rangers
talking, and their camp was on the other side
of Trinity. Everything that approached us
on the plains&mdash;even the cattle, which, having
had a rest after their drink, were beginning to
crop the grass&mdash;loomed up on us to twice
its natural size, and everything betokened
rain; but we had seen so many such nights
as that in Texas that we never gave it a
moment’s thought. We walked our horses
until we could no longer hear the Rangers
talking, and then put them to a little faster
gait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[140]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t get over the way that man Henderson
has acted,” said Tom. “It seems to
me that you ought to have told somebody
of it.”</p>

<p>“How many men did you ever see killed in
a fair, stand-up fight?” I asked.</p>

<p>“None, I am glad to say.”</p>

<p>“I have, and that’s the reason I didn’t tell
anybody what I saw. Henderson wouldn’t
have been alive now.”</p>

<p>“I guess, after all, you did for the best,”
added Tom; “but I would have been too mad
to take a second thought. How do you suppose
Henderson knew that his brother was
with this outfit?”</p>

<p>I replied that he didn’t know it at all. He
was only a speculator, and when the Rangers
were ordered out to preserve the peace he
came out with them, to see if he could find
something that was worth buying.</p>

<p>“And if we don’t find the will he’s got a
fine lot now,” I said. “Just think of the
eight or nine thousand head of cattle he got
from Mr. Davenport. Now that he has got
them here he can sell them for five dollars a<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
head, easy enough. That will be more than
enough to put him on his feet.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you that will is going to spoil
his kettle of fish!” answered Tom, as confidently
as though he had the document in his
pocket. “You will see that we will have it
in our hands when we come back this way.”</p>

<p>I wished then that I felt as confident of it
as Tom did, but somehow I saw too many
difficulties in the way. In the first place,
there was Henderson, who wouldn’t believe
that that pocket-book was the only one Mr.
Davenport had, and would be equally certain
to send someone to the ranch to look for it.
And if he found it, I wasn’t sure that we
could get it away from him. When a man
pulls a loaded gun on you and tells you to
stand where you are, you had better stand.
Then, again, there was the invalid, with all
his eccentricities of hiding things where no
one would ever think of looking for them; in
fact, I didn’t believe he could have found it
himself if he had been going to the ranch
with us. Taking these two things into consideration,
I thought we had undertaken<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
something of a scheme. But I said nothing
about it, for I did not want to discourage
Tom. Everything depended on him.</p>

<p>For hours we rode along, talking over matters
and things that had fallen to our lot in
Texas, and were beginning to look around for
a belt of post oaks, in which we could camp
for the day, when Tom, who was going on
ahead, suddenly stopped and held up his
finger. I had heard the same sound, but
didn’t think it best to speak of it. Presently
it came again, faint and far off, but there was
no mistaking it.</p>

<p>“It is thunder, as sure as I am a foot high,”
said Tom, his face brightening as if he had
just discovered something.</p>

<p>“It is, for a fact! I heard it long ago,
but you were so busy talking that you didn’t
notice it,” I replied. “I really believe it is
going to rain.”</p>

<p>“Grant that it may be a deluge. I will
gladly swim from here to the ranch if they
will only send water enough. There is some
timber straight ahead, and the sooner we
reach it the sooner we will be safe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[143]</span></p>

<p>It did look like rain, sure enough, and even
our horses felt the coming breeze and were not
disposed to wait for the spur. One would
have thought there was a regiment of cavalry
camped in the woods toward which we were
hastening, for the animals neighed to each
other as fast as they could take breath. The
sky became overcast, after a while the moon
was completely shut out from our view, and
then everything was as dark as one could
wish; but we were already headed for the
timber and did not care for that. At last we
were fairly inside the protecting branches, and
then the storm came. What a deluge it was!
It wasn’t a “norther,” such as we would have
expected a month or two later, but a regular
downpour of rain, and the lightning flashed
incessantly. Whatever it may have been for
us&mdash;and we were as wet as drowned rats
before we had staked out our horses&mdash;we
knew it was the life of half our cattle in the
drive. We whistled and sang as we took our
saddles off our horses and put them on the
leeward side of the trees so that we could
keep out of the storm, and all the while it was<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
so dark that we couldn’t see each other. Let
some of you who haven’t seen a drop of rain
for sixteen months, and the streams were all
dry, and you had to carry your water from a
distance, imagine how good it seemed to us.
Every time the lightning flashed with unwonted
fury, and it seemed to us that one or
the other of us had been struck, I would call
out as soon as I could make myself heard:
“Tom, are you there yet?” and the answer
that came back was always a cheering one:
“Yes, I’m here yet. A man who was born to
be hanged can’t be struck by lightning.”</p>

<p>To make a long story short the storm continued
all that day and never let up a bit;
and Tom and I slept through it all. We
picked out a comfortable position on the side
of the trees opposite the storm, and wrapping
up head and ears in blankets, went off into the
land of dreams. When we awoke the storm
had passed and the moon was just coming up,
and our first thought was to get something to
eat; for it had rained so hard all day that
any attempt to start a fire would have been
useless. Overjoyed as we were to see the<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
rain, we still had sense enough to take care
of our provisions. Tom had the salt stowed
away inside of his coat so that the water could
not get at it, and the meal I had provided for.
I had taken the bag that contained it in
between my knees and covered it over with
my blanket, and although the outside of the
meal was wet, the inside of it was perfectly
dry.</p>

<p>“Remember, now, that you are to get three
meals in one,” said Tom, handing out the salt
and going out to attend to the horses which,
having eaten all the boughs within reach, now
showed a disposition to get at the grass. “I
am as hungry as a wolf.”</p>

<p>It took an hour to get supper, and we did
full justice to it. By that time the horses had
got their fill of the grass, and I never saw
them act so much like themselves as they did
when we brought them in to put the saddles
on them. They acted as though they were
impatient to be off.</p>

<p>“Now we are fairly afloat again,” said
Tom, after we had ridden out on the prairie
and put our horses into a gentle lope. “I<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
wonder if that man Henderson has missed us
yet?”</p>

<p>“You may be sure he has,” I replied.
“And if he doesn’t send somebody to head us
off or come himself, I shall miss my guess.
We mustn’t think we are going to have this
all our own way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t!” said Tom hastily. “But
let me get the first pull at it and I’ll find that
pocket-book. My luck never went back on
me yet.”</p>

<p>I had not been long on the plains before I
became really amazed at the sight that was
presented to me. One, to have been with us,
would have thought that we had purposely
left a good portion of our herd behind, a
prey for the wolves, for as far as our eyes
could reach we saw cattle that had been
abandoned by us as unfit to go farther, deliberately
engaged in cropping the grass. The
rain had revived them and they were doing
what they could to save themselves. There
must have been a thousand head within the
range of our vision, and I knew that the
cattlemen would soon be out after them. I<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
expressed this hope to Tom and was surprised
to find that he did not agree with me.</p>

<p>“You hope the cattlemen will come out
after them?” said he, looking amazed.
“Well, I don’t! The men will be certain to
see us&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They won’t be out for a day or two, and
consequently we’ll be beyond their reach,”
I answered. “I am not afraid of the cattlemen.
It is that Henderson that I am
afraid of.”</p>

<p>We were eight days on the road, and all the
time our horses showed signs of increased
vigor, and at last we came across some things
which Tom remembered; and finally the
whitewashed walls of the ranch came into
view. Then Tom began to look sober. It
was easy enough to talk about finding the
pocket-book, but to <em>find</em> it was a different
thing. We approached the ranch with fear
and trembling because we didn’t know who
had been there since we left, but we found
everything just as it ought to be. We
thought it necessary to stake out our horses
because the rain had started the grass so<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
much that they would have strayed off before
we had left them an hour.</p>

<p>“Now, Tom,” said I, as I drove the picket-pin
into the ground and picked up my rifle
and put it on the porch, so as to have it
handy, “come on and show us your luck.
Your luck never went back on you yet, and
this is the time to prove it. Yes, sir; everything
is just as we left it,” I added, as I
pushed open the door. “There has nobody
been here.”</p>

<p>Tom placed his rifle in one corner of the
cabin and walked over to Mr. Davenport’s
bed as confidently as though he already felt
the pocket-book in his grasp, picked up the
clothing one by one and shook them out,
placing the articles carefully on the floor, so
that he wouldn’t have to look at them again,
and I sat down in the invalid’s rocking chair
and watched his movements. But not a thing
happened to come out. At last he came to
the mattress, but here, too, his luck was at
fault. Slowly and by handfuls he took out
the hay with which the mattress had been
stuffed, but not a thing in the shape of a<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
pocket-book did he find. Then he removed
the wooden slats that held the bed up and
cautiously scrutinized every opening, and
even looked under the bed itself, but it was
all in vain. Whatever else the invalid did
with his property, he certainly hadn’t hid it
about where he lay.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Search for the Missing Pocket-book</span>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“I declare, my luck has played me false
for once in my life,” said Tom, seating himself
on the bed and giving up with blank
despair. “I was sure that pocket-book was
hidden somewhere about his bed.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I must take a hand,” said I,
pulling over one of the other beds. “Here
are plenty of others to be examined. Let’s
pull them all to pieces.”</p>

<p>Tom went to work once more, but I knew
we were on the wrong scent. We pulled all
the beds to pieces, and then I got a chair and
devoted myself to the rafters, especially all
around the house where they came down to
the wall, and Tom got a sharp stick somewhere
and pried up the stones there were in
the fireplace, but not a thing did we find.
We spent at least an hour on the inside of the<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
ranch, and then, utterly discouraged, we went
out on the porch and I pulled out my pipe.</p>

<p>“My luck has gone back on me, too,”
said I. “Where do you suppose Mr. Davenport
hid that thing?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he could tell himself if he
were alive,” answered Tom. “He must have
felt very bad when he hid it, for he took the
wrong pocket-book. Do you imagine he hid
it under the house?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. We might as well look
everywhere, now that we are here. There is
one thing about it,” I added, “he didn’t
know but he had the right one at the time
he fell from his horse. When he fell he put
his hands on his pocket-book. Who are
those coming there?”</p>

<p>I did not need to point out the direction of
the three men who were approaching, because
they were in plain sight, and Tom saw them
readily enough. They were coming fast, too,
as if they feared they might be too late. Tom
never changed his position, nor did he make
an effort to pick up his rifle.</p>

<p>“It is somebody coming to look for the<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
pocket-book,” said he. “Let them go on and
see what sort of luck they will have. It
wouldn’t surprise me if they went straight
to it.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; they can’t do that!” said I
hastily. “We have been to every spot in the
ranch,&mdash;in the cupboard, the fireplace, the
beds,&mdash;and I would like to see them haul out
a thing the size of that pocket-book that we
have missed. I declare, it is Henderson and
Coyote Bill. They’re there as big as life.
Now, where did Henderson find Coyote Bill
so quickly? That is what I should like to
know.”</p>

<p>I was in something of a trap; I could see
that plainly enough. If Coyote Bill should
accuse me of treachery, there was only one
thing he could do with me. They came up as
swiftly as their horses could foot it, and I saw
that one of them carried his revolver in his
hand. We sat there on the porch and looked
at them. Coyote Bill was the first one who
spoke.</p>

<p>“Morning,” said he cheerfully. “Did you
boys find it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[152]</span></p>

<p>“We found never the thing,” answered
Tom. “We stayed here in hopes that you
would go straight to it. We have been in
every place and it isn’t there.”</p>

<p>“Well, you two can stand up and put your
hands above your heads,” said the stranger.
“We’ll begin the search by going through
you first.”</p>

<p>“Say, Pete, you won’t find anything
there,” interposed Bill.</p>

<p>“I’m going through them to find out,”
answered Pete. “I am going to look in every
nook and corner of the place before I go
away. That pocket-book is here and we are
going to have it.”</p>

<p>With one accord Tom and I arose to our
feet, extended our hands above our heads,
and Pete put up his revolver and proceeded
to “sound” us very thoroughly. He felt in
all our pockets, and run his hand over the
seams of our clothing, to see if there was anything
there to remind him of papers that had
been stowed away.</p>

<p>“You needn’t be so particular,” said I.
“We have been here about an hour before<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
you came, and we haven’t had time to stow
away any papers. We wouldn’t be foolish
enough to do that, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Never you mind,” said Pete. “I am
going through you. Some of you boys know
where that pocket-book is, and I’m going to
know too, before I get through with you.”</p>

<p>“Holy Moses! Just look a-here!” said
Coyote Bill, who just then entered the house.
“If the pocket-book was in here those boys
have got it, sure.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you we haven’t got it,” said I.
“We are just as anxious to find it as you are.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to give it up?” said Pete,
once more drawing out his revolver. “Where
is it?”</p>

<p>“You can shoot if you please, but I tell
you that you won’t make anything by it,”
I replied, looking him squarely in the eye.
“That pocket-book is hidden where no one
will ever find it.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where it is?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t! And that is the honest
truth.”</p>

<p>“Aw! Pete, let him alone,” said Bill.<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
He stood just on the threshold with his
hands against his hips, but making no effort
to continue the search we had begun. “He
hasn’t got it. It isn’t here, and we might as
well go under the house. Have you boys
looked up among the rafters?”</p>

<p>“Yes; we have looked everywhere.”</p>

<p>I wasn’t as thoroughly cowed as some boys
might have been, for I saw that Coyote Bill
was disposed to be friendly toward me; so I
had plenty of time to study the expression on
Henderson’s face. When he first rode up to
the ranch it wore a determined look which
said that he knew we had the object of which
we were in search, and that he was bound to
have it; but when he watched the results of
Pete’s examination, and stood in the door and
witnessed the confusion that Tom and I had
made in the cabin, the expression of serious
resolve he had on his countenance gave way
to a look of intense and bitter rage. The
ranch looked as bad as the wagon did when he
got through with it. If he had been alone
and held the power in his hands I wouldn’t
have felt so much at my ease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[155]</span></p>

<p>“Well, you see it isn’t here, don’t you?”
said Coyote Bill soothingly. “I don’t believe
the old man had any other pocket-book,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“That’s my opinion,” said Pete. “If he
had, where is it?”</p>

<p>This was enough to set Henderson fairly to
boiling, but he dared not show it.</p>

<p>“I say he did!” said he, striving hard to
keep down his rising anger. “What made
Bob look so blue when the contents of this
pocket-book were read? I tell you that the
old man had another, and it is somewhere
in this house.”</p>

<p>“I think he had another one, too,” I answered,
wishing to keep on good terms with
Bill. Although he didn’t say much, I could
see that he was on the very point of using his
revolver; and as I had seen something of that
kind once or twice before, I did not care to see
another. “He has got another pocket-book
somewhere, but whether he took it in the
wagon with him or left it here in the house, I
don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Where is it, then?” asked Bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[156]</span></p>

<p>“That’s more’n I know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to take such a ride as this for
nothing, and I am going under the house,”
said Bill. “Come on, Pete.”</p>

<p>“But aint you afraid to trust these boys
here alone?” asked Pete.</p>

<p>“No. I trusted one of them before I made
any move; didn’t I, Carlos?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he went back on you,” said
Henderson. “If he didn’t you would have
got the pocket-book.”</p>

<p>“Did you go back on me, Carlos?”</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty question for a man to
ask,” I answered, scowling savagely at Henderson.
“I knew you could shoot as well as
anybody.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I knew, too. Come on, Pete!
If Henderson is afraid to trust them, he can
stay here with them.”</p>

<p>But that was something Henderson was not
prepared to do. He wanted to be close to the
men when they found that pocket-book, for
there was so much in it that he was afraid
to trust them alone with it; so when they
moved off and crawled under the ranch, he<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
went with them. Tom and I returned to our
seats on the porch, saying never a word to
each other, and for an hour listened to the
movements of the men that were under the
house. Sometimes I was almost certain they
had found it, but when they came out after
their search was over, I told myself that the
invalid had never hidden anything under
there, for they were as dirty as they could
well be. They were all mad, but Coyote Bill
brightened up when he saw me.</p>

<p>“Well, Carlos, you think you won’t go with
me?” said he.</p>

<p>“And steal cattle?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what some folks call it,” said
Bill, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“No, I think I will stay here and be honest.
I find I can make a living better that way than
I can by stealing. Are you going to give up
the search?”</p>

<p>“We might as well. There is no pocket-book
here, or if there is it is hidden where no
one will ever find it. So we may as well give
it up and go down there to Trinity.”</p>

<p>Henderson was not yet satisfied. He had<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
given the under part of the house a good overhauling,
had prodded every little mound of
earth that looked as though it might recently
have been thrown up, and now he was going
to try the upper part. He had brought a
stick with him, and with it he dug down in
the fireplace until he went so far that the
solid earth resisted his efforts, and all the
while the men stood by watching him. After
that he devoted his attention to the things we
had taken off the beds, throwing them into
one corner, and when the last handful of hay
had been tossed aside he was obliged to confess
that there was nothing there.</p>

<p>“Are you satisfied now?” asked Bill. “If
you are, we are going.”</p>

<p>“That pocket-book is somewhere about this
ranch, and I know it,” said Henderson. “I
don’t like to give it up.”</p>

<p>But all the same, when he saw his companions
mounting their horses, in readiness to
go away, he followed their example. They
went away without saying a good word to us.
Tom settled back in his chair and crossed his
legs, while I filled my pipe and looked at him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">HENDERSON IS ASTONISHED.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">“Where is all your luck gone now,
Tom?” I enquired.</p>

<p>“It’s gone,” said Tom disconsolately,
“and I am left here flat on my back. I could
have taken my oath that the pocket-book was
hidden somewhere about that bed. What
do you suppose made that Coyote Bill so
friendly with you? If there had been any
other man than you here he would have
talked rough to him.”</p>

<p>“And perhaps have done something
rough,” I added. “I don’t know what
made him act so, unless he had an idea that
he was going to get me to go off with him.
He is going to see some trouble some day.
But what about breakfast? I am getting
hungry.”</p>

<p>“Let us put some of these stones back<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
where they belong and cook our breakfast in
here,” said Tom. “Somehow I don’t feel
like going out in the woods. That pocket-book
is concealed around here, and I would
like to know where it is.”</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders, and seized a
bucket to go out and bring some water, and
Tom, taking that as an answer that he could
guess the matter as well as I, went in to put
some of the stones back in the fireplace. I
was not gone more than ten minutes, and
when I came back I found Tom on the porch
fairly convulsed with excitement. He could
hardly stand still.</p>

<p>“Say, Carlos, where are the men that were
here?” he stammered, as plainly as he could
speak.</p>

<p>“They have just ridden over that hill out of
sight,” I replied. “Is anything up?”</p>

<p>“There’s no chance for them to come
back?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. They are gone.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any of their party loafing
around ready to come back and see what we
have found, is there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>

<p>“Why, Tom,” I exclaimed, “have you
found the pocket-book?”</p>

<p>“Come in here,” said Tom, seizing me by
the arm and dragging me into the ranch.
“Now, there’s the pocket-book&mdash;&mdash; Well, it
isn’t in plain sight, but it is so near it that
you will think those men ought to have discovered
it. See here!”</p>

<p>Tom seized a stick which one of the men
had used and began poking around in the
ashes that covered the hearthstone. No one
had thought of moving that stone, for it was
so large that the sticks which supported the
chimney came down on each side of it; but
the dirt under the edges of it had been thrown
out, until it was found that there was nothing
there. The ashes which concealed it were
those that had been left there from the last
fire Mr. Davenport had made, when he didn’t
feel like going out of doors, and there was
scarcely enough of them to cover a quarter of
a dollar, let alone a good-sized pocket-book;
but Tom knew right where to go, and with the
second prod he brought out the pocket-book&mdash;the
identical mate to the one that was now in<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
camp. Mr. Davenport had concealed it there
on the morning after Coyote Bill had made an
effort to steal it, and had forgotten where he
put it. The one that contained the receipts
he had placed under his pillow, and when
we got ready to start in the morning,&mdash;we
packed up in something of a hurry, you will
understand,&mdash;he had taken that one with him!
I was profoundly astonished. I jumped forward
and picked up the pocket-book, giving
it a slap or two in my hands to clear it of the
ashes that clung to it, and opened it.</p>

<p>“I tell you my luck hasn’t gone back on
me yet,” said Tom, who was overjoyed at his
discovery.</p>

<p>“Why, Tom, how did you find it?” I
asked. I couldn’t think of anything else to
say.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking about it all the
time,” answered Tom. “And I couldn’t
think of any place in the house that had not
been looked into except these ashes, so I
began to poke into them. At the second jab
I made, out came the pocket-book.”</p>

<p>I looked around until I found a chair, and<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
then seated myself to examine the pocket-book;
for you will remember that we had
taken a long ride, and we did not want to
take another with the same object in view.
The papers were all folded neatly away, and
as I opened the first one I came to, my eyes
caught the words: “In the name of God,
Amen.” That was the will, and it was all
right. I looked at the conclusion, and there
were the names of all of us as witnesses. The
next paper I opened was a letter of instructions
to Bob, and told him how to carry on
his business if he wanted to make a success
of it.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to look any further,” I said,
folding up the papers. “Tom, you’ve got it
as sure as the world.”</p>

<p>Tom did not make any reply at once. He
went out on the porch and all around the
ranch to make sure that there was no one
listening to us.</p>

<p>“Say, Carlos!” he exclaimed, as soon as he
came back, “I’ve found the will, and now you
have got to take charge of it. If you see anybody
coming toward us on the way home, just<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
take out the pocket-book and drop it into the
grass, and then when they have gone we’ll
come and find it. How does that strike
you?”</p>

<p>“That will do,” I replied. “Then we can
say that we don’t know where it is, only we’ll
have to keep a close watch of landmarks to
find the place where we hid it. I wish I had
your luck.”</p>

<p>“I wish you had too,” replied Tom, with a
smile. “I notice that everybody is poking
fun at me on account of it, but I tell you
sometimes it comes handy. Now, if you will
go out and cook breakfast I’ll put everything
back as I found it.”</p>

<p>The breakfast didn’t amount to much, for
we were anxious to begin our homeward
journey to see what effect the result of our
search would have upon Bob. There was not
one man in ten, who knew what we were going
to the ranch for, who would have predicted
our success, and we were equally anxious to
hear what Lem and Frank would have to say
about it. I heard Tom strike up a lively
whistle in the ranch while I was gathering<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
wood for the fire, and in a few minutes he
came out.</p>

<p>“Say!” he exclaimed. “What will you
bet that Henderson isn’t getting a good going
over by this time?”</p>

<p>“I am quite sure he is,” said I. “You
know Pete said he didn’t believe Mr. Davenport
had another pocket-book, and Coyote
Bill agreed with him. But we knew a story
worth two of that!”</p>

<p>“I know it. And to think that we should
find it before they were fairly out of sight of
the building. Who&mdash;pee! My luck never
went back on me yet.”</p>

<p>Tom went back to his work, and when I
had the bacon fairly under way and the corn
bread done, I invited him to come out and eat
breakfast, if his excitement would allow him
to eat any. He had the things mostly picked
up. Two of the beds hadn’t been touched,
and we would leave them for the cowboys
who wouldn’t have anything else to do. He
came, and the way the breakfast disappeared
was a caution. He ate more than I could have
eaten to save my life, and I came to the conclusion<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
that the excitement was not all on his
side. In half an hour more we were on our
homeward journey, and during the whole of
that ride there was nothing happened that
was worthy of narration. We performed the
ride almost entirely by daylight. When we
slept it was in a grove of post-oaks, and any
one who had come upon our camp would not
have found the pocket-book. I took particular
pains to hide it before we turned in,
and when morning came it was always there.
It rained for two days during our journey, but
we didn’t mind that, and it was not long
before we began to strike the advance guards
of our cattle. No fight had occurred between
the farmers and our outfit, because the former
were men and knew just what they would do
under the same circumstances. They and the
Rangers camped on the other side of Trinity
to see that we did not drive our cattle over,
and when it rained the Rangers knew that
their work was done and started at once for
home, while the farmers remained a few days
longer to guard their crops. Almost the first
man we saw was Clifford Henderson, who was<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
out trying to sell his stock to some cattlemen,
but the cattlemen did not like the way he had
come in charge of it, and would not consent to
buy. When he saw us approaching he rode
to meet us, accompanied by three or four of
the men whom he had been trying to induce
to buy his cattle.</p>

<p>“I am glad I don’t feel the way I did when
I last saw this stock,” said Tom. “I tell you
I was glum then, and didn’t know whether
my luck was going to stand me in hand or not.
There comes Henderson, but he has got some
of our men with him, so that we need not be
afraid. It beats me how he can associate with
fellows like Coyote Bill, and then hold up his
head when he gets among honest men.”</p>

<p>“He knows that we won’t tell of him until
the proper time comes,” said I. “I’ll bet
you that by the time this business is settled
you can’t put your hands on him.”</p>

<p>“Where will he go?”</p>

<p>“He’ll put out. Just as soon as he finds
the will in our hands he will skip. You see
if he don’t.”</p>

<p>But at this moment Henderson came along<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
as though he had a perfect right to be there.
He was talking, and laying down some law to
the men.</p>

<p>“I tell you that pocket-book was the only
one Mr. Davenport had,” said he. “When
he was taken with that fit and fell from his
horse, he placed his hands upon it to be sure
that it was safe. Here are the boys; you can
ask them. Did you find it?”</p>

<p>“Find what?” I asked; for I knew that
Tom would expect me to do all the talking.</p>

<p>“Find the pocket-book,” continued Henderson.
“These men insist that there is
another one somewhere, and that I haven’t
got any right to the cattle. Now I want to
know if you found it.”</p>

<p>“We looked over every place that you
looked and didn’t find any,” I answered.
“Every place except under the house.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t blame you for not going
there,” said Henderson, with a laugh. “We
went under there and got as dirty as so many
pigs. You saw me come there with two men,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“You certainly did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[169]</span></p>

<p>“And I looked everywhere for the pocket-book
and didn’t find it,” added Henderson.
“In fact I examined everything, and not a
thing in the shape of a pocket-book did I discover.
I tell you, gentlemen, there is none
there. Now, I can sell you these cattle
cheaper than you can buy them anywhere
else. I have got to go North on business,
and I may not come back; and I want
to get rid of everything I have got down
here.”</p>

<p>“Of all the impudence I ever heard, you are
the beat,” I muttered, and it was all I could
do to keep from pulling out the pocket-book
and shaking it under Henderson’s nose; but
I knew that wouldn’t do. I must first place
the pocket-book in Mr. Chisholm’s hands, and
then I could say what I had a mind to.
While Henderson was talking he kept his
eyes fastened upon one man, and another in
the group looked as fixedly at me. I scowled
at him repeatedly, and finally the man brightened
up and said slowly:</p>

<p>“I’d like to buy these cattle, because I can
get them cheaper than I can anywhere else;<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
but I want to be certain that the man has got
a right to them before he lets ’em go.”</p>

<p>“All the will that was made was in that
pocket-book,” said Henderson impatiently.
“And you all saw that there was no will at
all. Being next of kin I am entitled to all his
property.”</p>

<p>“<em>But</em>,” continued the man, “the boys say
they did not find anything while you were
there. Now I want to know if they found
anything after you left. That’s what’s
a-bothering of me.”</p>

<p>I didn’t make any reply to this question,
I wanted it to be put to me before I answered.
The men all looked at me, but I remained as
dumb as one of the cattle that were feeding
around.</p>

<p>“You don’t answer that question,” said the
man.</p>

<p>“Do you ask it of me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I do. There is nobody else to
answer it.”</p>

<p>“Then you have got me pinned down to
a fine point, and if I reply to the question I
shall do so truthfully. I did find something<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
after he left&mdash;or rather Tom did, and it
amounts to the same thing.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“A pocket-book.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” shouted Henderson, his
eyes blazing with excitement. “Hand it out
here!”</p>

<p>“It’s in my pocket, and there it will stay
until I can give it into the hands of Mr.
Chisholm,” I answered, as firmly as I could.
“In it is a will which relates to Bob Davenport&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is a fraud!” exclaimed Henderson,
turning all sorts of colors. “Hand it out
here so that I can look at it! I am not going
to be cheated out of my cattle in this way.”</p>

<p>“The will is in Mr. Davenport’s own hand-writing,
and to it are attached our signatures,
with Bob as a witness.”</p>

<p>“It’s a fraud&mdash;a clean and scandalous lie!”
vociferated Henderson. “How much do you
boys calculate you are going to make out of
this?”</p>

<p>“Not a red cent!” I replied indignantly.
“But you can talk of making some money<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
out of it when you come to the ranch in company
with such men as&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That is neither here nor there,” interrupted
Henderson, who saw in a minute that
I was about to expose him. “I want you to
show me that will. I can tell you whether or
not it is genuine.”</p>

<p>“Well, boys, let’s go and hunt up Mr.
Chisholm,” said one of the men, who saw that
we were getting down to a fine point. “He is
the lawyer in this business and will know
exactly what ought to be done.”</p>

<p>“I am just as good a lawyer as he is, and I
don’t need one; and furthermore, I won’t
have any!” declared Henderson. “I tell you
I want to see the will. I will know whether or
not it is genuine. I am here alone and you
are five to my one. Let me see it, I tell you!”</p>

<p>Henderson was about as near crazy as a man
could get and live, and if we had been alone I
should have objected to show him the pocket-book;
but there were two men there whom I
was not afraid to trust. I looked at one of
them, and he said:</p>

<p>“As he is the next of kin I think he has a<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
right to see the will. You may show it to
him without any fear that he will get away
with it. Get on the other side of him,
boys!”</p>

<p>“If you are going to watch me in this way,
you can keep your old will!” said Henderson,
as plainly as he could speak, which, owing to
his excitement and rage, might have been
taken for something else. “You will find
that there is a surrogate in this county who
has to have the will proved, and I shall start
in search of him before I am an hour older.
Keep away from that horse. What are you
putting your hands on him for?”</p>

<p>Two of the men, without paying any attention
to what he said, “got around on the
other side of him,” one laying his hand upon
his bridle and the other drawing his revolver
and resting it across the hollow of his arm. I
saw that Henderson was fairly cornered, and
without any further comments I pulled out
the pocket-book and gave it to the spokesman.
When Henderson’s eyes rested upon it it was
all he could do to keep from snatching it.</p>

<p>“That first paper is the will,” said I. “It<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
is signed by Robert Davenport, who, when he
showed us the will, said: ‘I take my oath
that this is my proper signature,’ or words to
that effect. Tom Mason and I signed it,
while Elam Storm made his mark. He can’t
write, you know. Bob Davenport signed it
as a witness.”</p>

<p>“I see you are all against me, but I want to
see the will,” said Henderson. “You had
better mind what you are about, for they have
a queer way of dealing with men in this part
of the country who swear to a lie!”</p>

<p>“By gum! the boys have got it, sure
enough,” said the spokesman, as he ran his
eye rapidly over the paper. “‘In the name
of God, Amen! I, Robert Davenport, being
thoroughly convinced of the uncertainty of
life, do hereby give and bequeath to my son,
Robert Davenport, all the property of which I
may die possessed, to wit:’ There you have
it. Do you want to see it?”</p>

<p>The man who held the revolver raised it to
a level with Henderson’s head, the man who
had his grip on the bridle tightened it, and
the spokesman passed the will over to Henderson.<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
My heart was in my mouth, for I did
not know but the man, in his rage, would kill
himself; but he did nothing of the sort. He
ran his eye rapidly over the paper, and I saw
that he was trying to find the name of the
bank in which Mr. Davenport’s bonds were
deposited for safe keeping, and then I
interfered.</p>

<p>“That’s enough!” I exclaimed. “He
doesn’t want to get at the name of that
bank, because he may get there before we do.
Take it away from him!”</p>

<p>“You are too late, young man,” said Henderson,
as he readily gave up the will. “And
now, I will bid you good-by. You are a pack
of thieves, the last one of you!”</p>

<p>He made an effort to spur up his horse, but
the man who held his bridle was not to be
taken unawares.</p>

<p>“Take that back!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Well, you want me to call you something,
don’t you?” said Henderson.</p>

<p>I think he was the coolest man I ever saw.
That was twice he had looked into the muzzle
of a revolver when the man who stood behind<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
it was just on the point of shooting, but he
never changed color.</p>

<p>“Take it back!” said the man. “One&mdash;two&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you are gentlemen, the last
one of you,” said the culprit. “Now, let me
go, and when you get down to Austin you
may be sure you will find me there. There
isn’t any law against that, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No; you can go and come when you are a
mind to; but you be sure that you don’t come
around our camp to-night!”</p>

<p>“You may be sure that I shall never come
around there again. The next time you see
me I shall be backed up by law!”</p>

<p>The man who held his bridle released it,
and we sat in our saddles and saw Henderson
gallop away, while the one who held the will
folded it up and returned it to me. Henderson
evidently knew where he was going, for
he went in an awful hurry, and somehow I
couldn’t get it out of my mind that Bob was
going to see trouble over the will after all.
As we turned about and went back to camp I
said to our spokesman:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[177]</span></p>

<p>“Who is that officer who is going to examine
the will? I suppose we shall have to
go to Austin with Bob?”</p>

<p>“The surrogate? Yes, he is called that in
some States, but what in the world he is called
here I don’t know. I never had anything to
do with the proving of wills, but we will go
and see Mr. Chisholm. He will know all
about it. By gum! you fellows got it,
didn’t you? And you say that he and two
other men were there in the house and all
over it and never found it? Tell us all
about it.”</p>

<p>It did not take me long to tell the cattlemen
the history of our trip to the ranch and
back, but I left out all allusions to Coyote
Bill. I could do that and I knew that Tom
wouldn’t betray me. When the spokesman
asked me who the men were, I could tell him
that one was Henderson and the other was
’Rastus Johnson. Who the other was I
didn’t know, for I had been on the ranch all
the time, and my opportunities for making
acquaintances were very slight. I determined
to tell Mr. Chisholm all about it, for I assure<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
you I did not feel like having secrets from
my friends.</p>

<p>“’Rastus Johnson! I never knew him, but
his knowing something about that pocket-book
proves that he is a snake in the grass.
I wonder if he has anything to do with
Coyote Bill?”</p>

<p>“There comes Bob Davenport!” exclaimed
Tom suddenly. “He is more interested in
what we have to tell than anybody else.”</p>

<p>I never was so glad of an interruption in my
life. It got me out of a lie, plain enough. I
looked around, and there was Bob waving his
hat to us. It seems that the loss of his cattle
had not hurt him any, for he had his coat off
and was working with Mr. Chisholm’s men.
When I saw him coming I pulled out the
pocket-book and waved it over my head.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">OFF FOR AUSTIN.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">What Bob Davenport thought when he
saw me waving that pocket-book to
him, I don’t know. I held it extended in my
left hand and tapped it with my right as if to
say, “Here’s your will,” until he came up,
and then I saw his face was whiter than it was
when he thought he had lost his cattle.</p>

<p>“You’ve got it! You’ve got it as sure
as the world!” he exclaimed, as soon as
he came within speaking distance. “Is it
mine?”</p>

<p>“Tom Mason found it for you, and it is all
yours,” said I. “I don’t know how much
there is in it, because I haven’t read the will;
but I heard your father say that it was
all yours.”</p>

<p>With hands that trembled Bob took the
pocket-book and opened it; and as he gazed
upon the hand-writing of his father now laid<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
away among the willows, his eyes filled with
tears. Mr. Davenport, I afterward learned,
had been buried near the scene of his death,
and the cattlemen had made a heavy box and
loaded it with stones to protect it from the
wolves. Bob had not yet recovered from his
father’s sudden death, but Clifford Henderson
was not at the funeral, and when remonstrated
with by the cattlemen for his want of
sympathy for the fate of his brother, said
gruffly:</p>

<p>“Why should I want to see him buried?
He drove me away from home by his ingratitude
eight years ago, and I have never got
over it. He seems to have one mourner there,
and that is enough.”</p>

<p>Bob Davenport, we repeat, read the will
from the beginning to the end, also the letter of
instructions, and we sat on our horses waiting
for him to finish. When he was through he
folded up the letter, closed the pocket-book,
and handed it back to me.</p>

<p>“Why, Bob, it is yours,” I said.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied; “you fellows found it.
I should never have seen it if it hadn’t been<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
for you, and I wish you to take and hand it to
Mr. Chisholm. When he says I may have it
all, I will take it; not before. I left him here
at the wagon when I came up.”</p>

<p>We followed Bob back to the wagon, and
there we found Mr. Chisholm, smoking as
usual. He knew there was something up, for
we had waited almost fifteen minutes for Bob
to read the letter, but he said not a word
until I rode up and gave him the pocket-book.
Then he opened it and read the first line of
the will, after which he folded it up and
placed it in his own pocket.</p>

<p>“Is it all right?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It is all there,” replied Bob. “I read the
whole of it.”</p>

<p>“Which was the lucky fellow?”</p>

<p>I jerked my thumb over my shoulder toward
Tom Mason, and in another moment Mr. Chisholm
had him from his horse.</p>

<p>“By George, Tommy, you did nobly!” said
he, lifting Tom from the ground with one hand
and giving him a grip with the other that
must have brought tears of pain to his eyes.
“I believe now that you found the nugget,<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
but I was not prepared to swallow it all
when I first heard of the story.”</p>

<p>“Course he did! Didn’t he find my
nugget when it had been buried out of
sight longer than I can remember? Give
us your grip, Tom.”</p>

<p>We looked up, and there was Elam Storm
coming around the wagon. He had his
sleeves rolled up, and a person who knew
him would have hesitated about shaking
hands with him; but Tom took it without
ceremony. There was genuine affection between
the two boys, and it showed itself
in the way they greeted each other.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” said Mr. Chisholm, who
could not have been more delighted if the will
he had in his possession had deeded some
property to him instead of to Bob, “the next
thing is something else. I wish when you
start out again that you would see every
cowboy that you can, and tell him to come
to my wagon after supper, for I have got
some things that will interest them. I promised
to do some more talking to them when
I got the will, and now I am in a condition<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
to do it. Tell Henderson to come
along too.”</p>

<p>“Henderson won’t be here,” said our
spokesman.</p>

<p>“Ah! Skipped out, has he?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He said we were thieves, the last
one of us, and we asked him to take it back
and never show his face in our camp again.
He left in a mighty hurry, and I guess he was
going somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Mr. Chisholm, with a
sidelong glance at me. “Well, you send all
the boys up here. We have something here
now that will put a different look on the
matter.”</p>

<p>“Now, Bob,” continued our spokesman,
“we haven’t had a chance before to tell you
how pleased we are at your good fortune.
Shake!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I took it for granted,” said Bob,
accepting the cowboys’ hands, one after the
other. “You have been so good to me ever
since I lost my cattle that I knew you sympathized
with me. I am glad to receive your
congratulations.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[184]</span></p>

<p>We stood there at the wagon and saw the
cowboys ride away and Elam engaged in conversation
with Tom, and then I motioned to
Mr. Chisholm to follow me off on one side.
There were two things that I wanted to speak
to him about.</p>

<p>“You know when Henderson read that will,
do you not?” I began.</p>

<p>“I thought I did,” he replied. “You had
him cornered so that he couldn’t get away or
destroy it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He read it rapidly, much more
so than I could have done if I had had the
paper, and he wanted to get at the name of the
bank where the money was kept on deposit&mdash;that
is, where the bonds were kept. Then I
interfered and the men took the paper away
from him.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Mr. Chisholm.</p>

<p>“He said I was too late,” I continued.
“And then he gave me to understand that he
had got all he wanted. He said that the next
time I saw him would be in Austin&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“W-h-e-w!” whistled Mr. Chisholm.</p>

<p>“Yes. And then he would have the law to<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
back him up. He would go to the surrogate
and challenge the will. Now, it seems to me
that he could make us a heap of trouble by
doing that.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm knocked the ashes from his
pipe and filled up for another smoke, all the
while keeping his eyes fastened upon me. I
knew he was thinking deeply about something,
and made no attempt to interrupt him.</p>

<p>“Well?” said he, when he had come to
some conclusion.</p>

<p>“And there’s another thing I wanted to
speak to you about,” I continued. “I can’t
help it because Coyote Bill should be so
friendly with me, can I?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;no; if you haven’t done anything
to make him so.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know what Mr. Davenport told
you, don’t you? He thinks because I lost
my cattle I am down on everybody who has
not lost theirs. Now, he was one of the party
who came up there to search the house.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter. You couldn’t have
kept him away from there if he was a mind to
come, and I confess I thought something was<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
up when Henderson came up missing the next
morning.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to get these men down
on me because he acts so. He asked me if I
was going with him and help him steal cattle,
and I told him I was not. He tried his best
to get me interested in the matter before he
made any move, but I wouldn’t do it, and it
was only by taking Elam into my confidence
that I was able to upset him.”</p>

<p>“Well, you just let Coyote Bill go and
trust to me,” said Mr. Chisholm, giving me
his hand to shake. “If anybody says anything
to you about it send them to me. But
I don’t know what to make of Henderson’s
going to Austin. If he should get the cattle
thrown into the hands of a trustee, and have
some sort of an arrangement made by which
he could keep the bonds out of our grasp&mdash;&mdash; Who-pee!
By George! We would be in a
fix then.”</p>

<p>“But could he do that?” I asked, alarmed
at the proposition. “Just see all the writings
we would have.”</p>

<p>“He could do it if we had a thousand times<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
as much. He could just challenge the will,
and by giving some little pettifogger money
enough, and promising him as much more if
succeeded, he could have it thrown into chancery
and keep us out of it forever. He could
do it easily enough. I never did like that
man Henderson, anyway.”</p>

<p>Of course Mr. Chisholm made things different
from what they were, and anybody could
see that he didn’t know much about law; but
it had an effect upon me, as I didn’t know anything
about the ins and outs of the profession.
I had never had any experience in it in my
life, and I was appalled by his story of what
that bad man could do in the way of contesting
the will if he tried. It was Bob’s, and
why couldn’t Bob have it? In a new State
like Texas, law was not considered to be of as
much use as it was in some older communities,
and there was but one thing I could
think of to use in Henderson’s case, and that
was, to get him out of the way. I looked at
Mr. Chisholm and could see that he was
thinking of the same thing.</p>

<p>“There is but one way out of it,” he continued,<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
after he had thought the matter over,
“and that is a revolver shot. That will end
all difficulty. This thing that he has got on
his side may be law, but it is not justice.”</p>

<p>“There may be a better way than that,” I
added, for I was disposed to be a boy of
peace, “and it won’t do any harm to try it,
for it will bring mischief to no one but Henderson.
If we could prove that he was in
cahoots with Coyote Bill&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Set me down for a blockhead!” exclaimed
Mr. Chisholm, once more extending his hand.
“But you are the very boy I want. You
think of everything before I do. Of course
we can prove it, for didn’t you and Tom
Mason see him and talk with him when he
came out there to the ranch? Carlos, you be
around to-night, for we are going to Austin.
We’ll take along sufficient men to keep
Coyote Bill away from us if he sees us on the
way, and go down and prove the will. Now,
keep mum, for I don’t want any man around
here to know it. So long!”</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm and I returned to the wagon,
and I invited myself to the dinner which<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
Elam had served up in great shape for Tom
Mason. Of course Bob was there and his face
was radiant. I didn’t exactly understand
what Mr. Chisholm meant by saying that we
would go down to Austin to prove the will,
but I was in for it. He seemed to think there
was going to be a fight before we got there,
but when I looked at Bob, so joyous now
when he had been so distressed and cast
down when he thought he had lost all his
father’s property, I told myself that I was in
for that too. There was one thing about it:
Clifford Henderson wouldn’t get those bonds,
or the cattle either, by simply asking for them.</p>

<p>“Tom Mason is the one you want to thank
for finding that pocket-book,” I said, as I sat
down beside him. “Elam, have you got a
slice of bacon for me?”</p>

<p>“I know just what you both did and what
you passed through when you were there,”
said Bob. “This is no place for me to thank
you. I will do that at some future time.”</p>

<p>For the first time it occurred to me that
Bob might want to give Tom some present for
being so lucky, and I was strongly in favor of<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
that. For myself I didn’t want anything, for
I had sold all my property to Uncle Ezra, who
still had some of my money left in case I
should happen to find him when dead broke;
but Tom had suddenly taken it into his head
that he must return home with the amount of
money he had stolen from his uncle, and I
was in favor of helping him out. When Bob
got all his cattle and bonds safe to himself,
that would be the time for him to act. I
resolved that if he ever said anything to
me, I would tell him just what I thought
about it.</p>

<p>Between joking and laughing and driving
on the wagon to meet the cowboys at nightfall,
we passed the time agreeably enough.
Just before dark we came within sight of a
grove of post-oaks which had been selected
for our encampment, and there we found a
colony of wagons and almost all the cowboys.
Mr. Chisholm was there. He had ridden his
horse hard all the afternoon in the effort to
find all the men attached to his outfit to summon
them to appear at this hour, and when
we got up there I found that there were two<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
wagons missing. Everyone was glad to see
Bob. I never knew that boy had so many
friends, especially when Lem and Frank came
up, whom Mr. Chisholm had found herding
some cattle on the furthest flanks. Of course
they shook me warmly by the hand, but
devoted the most of their time and attention
to Tom Mason.</p>

<p>“I knowed you would find it, pilgrim,”
said Lem, holding fast to Tom with one hand
and patting him on the shoulder with the
other. “Whenever I lose anything I am
going to send you after it.”</p>

<p>Supper didn’t take much time, for all hands
were anxious to hear what was in the will, so
as soon as the motions had been gone through
they flocked up around the wagon to listen.
The time came for Mr. Chisholm to lay by
his pipe, which he did, and drew out the
pocket-book.</p>

<p>“I reckon we’ll find a little better reading
in this one than we did in the last,” said he,
holding it up where all could see it. “Has
our friend Henderson come in yet?”</p>

<p>Although they all knew that the culprit<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
was miles from there by that time, they all
looked at each other, but no one spoke.</p>

<p>“I reckon he’s skipped,” continued Mr.
Chisholm. “’Cause he was allowed to have
the reading of these papers I hold here; and
when he said we were all thieves, our friends
told him to be careful how he showed his face
in our camp to-night. The first paper I hold
in my hand is indorsed: ‘The last will and
testament of Robert Davenport.’ I will now
read it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm took off his hat and laid it
down beside him, and in a much slower and
more deliberate manner than he had used in
reading the contents of the other pocket-book,
the one that contained the receipts, he proceeded
to read the paper he held in his hand.
The testator made Robert Davenport the heir
to everything he possessed, horses, cattle, and
bonds, which were deposited for safe keeping
in the Merchant and Cattlemen’s Bank of
Austin, with a few exceptions. To each of his
cowboys, “for services long and faithfully
rendered,” he gave the sum of one thousand
dollars, and then came something I was glad<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
to see. To his half-brother, Clifford Henderson,
“to show that he had not forgotten
him,” he gave the sum of one dollar, and he
hoped that before he got through spending it
he would learn that honesty was the best
policy. The will was somewhat long, and I
was pleased to note one thing: the name of
the bank in which the bonds were kept did
not occur on the first page, but on the second!
and Henderson, when reading it, had read all
he wanted to see on the first page! By reading
that and going off in such a hurry he
tried to play a bluff game on us. He did not
know the name of the bank at all!</p>

<p>After that followed the letter of instructions,
which was so plain that anybody could
have understood it, and it wound up with the
entreaty to Bob to be honest; but having been
brought up all his life in that way the testator
did not think that Bob would depart from it.
Bob told me afterward that the letter talked
just as plainly as his father would to him.
Bob was very much overcome, and during the
reading he sat with his hands covering his
face, and I could see the tears trickling<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
through his fingers. By the time Mr. Chisholm
was through all the cowboys had their
hats off. He folded up the paper and waited
for somebody to make known his pleasure
concerning it. It was a long time before
anyone spoke. They seemed to be as much
affected by the reading of the will as Bob was.</p>

<p>“The will seems to be all right, Mr. Judge,”
said the oldest cattleman at last, “and I move
it be accepted by this meeting.”</p>

<p>“Second the motion!” shouted a dozen men
at once.</p>

<p>The motion was put and carried (we knew
that Henderson didn’t have a friend among
those cowboys), and then the pocket-book was
laid upon Bob’s knee. He was a rich man at
last. There were fifty good rifles to back him
up, and if Henderson or any of Coyote Bill’s
band had been there to take exceptions to it,
he would have been roughly handled. At
almost any other time they would have called
upon Bob for a speech, but instead of that
they let him go. He passed the pocket-book
back to Mr. Chisholm, with a few words expressive
of his gratitude, and begged him to<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
keep it for him until the matter was quite
settled, and arose and went off into the darkness.
He wanted to be alone, and none of us
intruded upon him.</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm was now prepared to carry
out the rest of his programme, and as soon as
the cattlemen had gone away he called some
of his cowboys to him and told them he
wanted them to take charge of Mr. Davenport’s
wagon on the following morning, for he
was going to Austin. He didn’t enter into any
explanations, for a ride of a hundred miles
was nothing for their employer to undertake,
but they agreed at once, and he sent them away.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, “the next thing is something
else. All you boys who have been
remembered in Mr. Davenport’s will, sit up
close around me, for I have something to tell
you. We must go to Austin as quickly as
we can, for we don’t know but that man Henderson
has gone there to challenge the will.”</p>

<p>“Will you allow me to say a word right
there, Mr. Chisholm?” I asked. “That man
Henderson doesn’t know the name of the
bank in which the bonds are deposited.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Because he read only the first page of
the will. If you took pains to notice, the
name doesn’t occur except on the second page,
and consequently he could not have seen it.”</p>

<p>“Well, by George! I never noticed that.
Did any of you boys take notice of it?
But I have got the will in my pocket.
We can easily satisfy ourselves on that
point. It is so,” he added, after referring to
the will, “and you are just the boy&mdash;&mdash; But
look here! If Henderson knows how, he can
just go down there and challenge the will,
anyway. He can say he doesn’t like the
way that property has been left, and so
make us some trouble on account of it.”</p>

<p>“Who will he have to go to when he
challenges it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Blessed if I know!”</p>

<p>“I’d just like to meet him to-morrow,”
said Frank.</p>

<p>“Here too,” said Lem. “You wouldn’t
have to do all your shooting alone, I can
tell you.”</p>

<p>“But you see you aint likely to meet him,”<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
said Mr. Chisholm. “Now, I think we had
better go to Austin right straight, in order to
get the start of him. Catch up!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that we are all to go?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do mean all of you; everyone who
is remembered in Mr. Davenport’s will, and
Bob and those of us who witnessed his
signature. Even Elam will have to go, for
he made his mark. I know the president of
that bank down there, for he holds a thousand
dollars or two of my money, and perhaps a
word coming from me will help straighten
the matter out. Lem, you and Frank get the
grub together. Elam, you hunt up Bob.”</p>

<p>And this was all the ceremony that was
employed in getting under way. In a few
minutes more there were ten of us, all well
mounted and armed and with provisions
enough to last us to Austin, who rode away
from the camp. I made up my mind to one
thing, and that was if Coyote Bill should discover
us and try to get that pocket-book away,
he would have a good time in doing it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">HENDERSON IN NEW BUSINESS.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">“I will get even with you for this. Bob
is not your son, and I will see that you
don’t adopt him, either. Whenever I see a
notice of your death&mdash;and you can’t live forever&mdash;I
will hunt that boy up and make him
know what it is to be in want, as I am at this
moment.”</p>

<p>I don’t suppose that when Clifford Henderson
shouted this defiance at his brother, on
the day he left him, after Mr. Davenport had
refused to take any further steps toward paying
his debts, that he really intended to go
to Texas, or, if he did, he never expected to
meet Bob there. He wanted to get away by
himself and think over his misfortune; for he
considered it a misfortune when his brother,
who was fairly rolling in wealth, should decline
to advance him the small sum when he
was so much in need of it. Henderson was<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
in sore straits&mdash;that is, for him. He had
money, but he was anxious to get a little
more, in order to go into a speculation in
which he was certain to lose all he had; and
it was when his brother declined to meet this
demand that he went into a rage.</p>

<p>“Old Bob wants me to go to work,” said
he, as he turned and shook his fist at the
house. “Not if I know it! I have seen him,
when he was not any older than I am, looking
around for a chance to put his money at interest,
and he never would have anything to
do with what I suggested to him. Never
mind; he is ’most dead with consumption,
and I will see what will become of Bob after
that.”</p>

<p>When he got a little further along the
street whom should he meet but the man
with whom he intended to go into the speculation.
It was buying waste land on the outskirts
of the city, which might some day be
profitable enough, but which would take
double the amount that he had to improve it.</p>

<p>“Well, Clifford, did you try your
brother?” he exclaimed, as soon as he got<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
within speaking distance. “I know you
have, for a fellow would not look as glum
as you do who had met with any success.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have tried him,” said Henderson,
taking the opportunity to whisper a few
choice swear words. “I have tried him, and
he can’t see it. He had but a few dollars left,
and he wants to invest that for Bob. Bob!
Everything is for Bob! I wish I could get
rid of that boy.”</p>

<p>“You know I told you, when he came back
from the mines and brought that boy with
him, that your cake was all dough,” said his
friend, who was about as disgusted as a man
could well be. “Why did not you take my
advice and put him away long ago?”</p>

<p>“Because I was a fool&mdash;that’s why! You
see I was afraid somebody would get
onto it.”</p>

<p>“They won’t if you do as I tell you. But
it is none of my funeral. If you can’t go into
the speculation I must go and hunt up somebody
else. I must have some of those acres
up there, for I know there is money in them.
Before I would be tied down by a little boy!<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
Good gracious! Why don’t you push him
overboard?”</p>

<p>“I never have a chance to go fishing with
him,” said Henderson.</p>

<p>“No matter. You could make chances
enough, I dare say. How does the boy feel
toward you?”</p>

<p>“Friendly enough. I don’t think old Bob
has mentioned my name to him for a long
time.”</p>

<p>“Does his tutor go with him everywhere?”</p>

<p>“Yes, everywhere. He can’t go out around
the block without the tutor sticks close at his
heels. If he would only send the boy to
school I would have a better show.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where the boy sleeps?”</p>

<p>“I bet you I do, but I don’t intend to fool
around there,” said Henderson, growing
alarmed. “He sleeps in a room opening off
from the tutor’s, and I tell you I wouldn’t
take a hand in it. That tutor is a big man
and is a match for both of us.”</p>

<p>“Could he get away with a sand-bag?”
said the friend, shutting one eye and looking
at Henderson with the other. “A man has<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
to be wide awake to meet such a thing as
that.”</p>

<p>“You may try it if you want to, and I’ll
give you half you make,” said Henderson.
“My brother is going to die in the course of a
year or two, and by the end of that time I
shall have money enough.”</p>

<p>“You can if he dies without making a will;
but how do you intend to get around it if he
names the boy as his heir?”</p>

<p>“If he doesn’t adopt him it is all right. I
tell you that would make me mad. In that
case I should probably wake up and do
something, and I should find myself in jail
before I was a week older.”</p>

<p>“Not if you manage rightly. But I must
go on. I must have that land before three
o’clock or the fat will all be in the fire.”</p>

<p>The friend walked away and Henderson
kept on his road down the street. We can
see from his conversation that he was not a
bad man at heart, but he ought to have been
rich, and in that case he would in a very short
time have found himself penniless. His expectations
ran greatly ahead of his income,<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
which at this time amounted to just nothing
at all. All he made aside from his brother’s
allowance was what he gained from little
speculations, and, furthermore, he was in the
hands of men who generally called on him for
everything they wanted, and with a fair prospect
of getting it. But now that Mr. Davenport
had refused him any more money,&mdash;he
had told him in plain language that he would
have to pay his own debts in future,&mdash;their
occupation was gone, and they must look elsewhere.
He sent for his clothing during the
day, and took up his abode at the hotel,
where he tried to make up his mind what he
ought to do.</p>

<p>“I have my choice between two courses of
action,” said he, as he lighted a cigar and sat
down in his room to think the matter over.
“One is, to shut Bob up in a lunatic asylum;
and the other is, to go fishing with him and
shove him overboard. Now, if anyone can
tell me which of those two is the safest, I will
be ready to listen to him. Nothing else
seems likely to happen to him.”</p>

<p>The worst of it all was, Mr. Davenport<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
knew that something was about to happen to
Bob. Almost a year before, when Mr. Davenport
had refused to advance money for some
of Henderson’s schemes, the latter had so far
forgotten himself as to make threats against
Bob. It alarmed his father, who at once took
Bob out of school and placed him under the
protection of a private teacher, a stalwart
man, a born athlete, and ready to hold his
own against all the men that Henderson could
bring against him. He slept, too, in a room
adjoining Bob’s, so that the boy was under
his care night and day. And it was all done
so quietly that Bob never suspected anything.
Wherever he went his tutor was ready to go
with him; he was a man whom he liked, and
he supposed that everything was just as it
should be.</p>

<p>“That was a bad thing for me,” soliloquized
Henderson, knocking the ashes from his cigar.
“If I had kept still about that I might have
got rid of Bob, and no one would have been
the wiser for it, but now he is lost to me.”</p>

<p>Of course his determination to push Bob
overboard when he went fishing with him was<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
knocked in the head by this arrangement, and
so was his desire to steal him away and lock
him up. This last, which was the idea of
the man he had left but a few minutes ago,
held out brighter promises than anything
else; and he had even gone so far as to
engage the doctor who was to take charge of
it, promising him five thousand dollars when
the boy was delivered into his hands, and as
much more if his object was successful. But
there he stopped. Henderson didn’t have the
pluck to go ahead with it, and there the
matter laid for over a year. Now it was
brought back to him with redoubled force.
Everything was going to Bob; he could see
that plainly enough, and it was high time he
was doing something. In fact, it had been
that way ever since Mr. Davenport returned
from the mines with this little nuisance,
picked up none knew where.</p>

<p>“He must go, and that’s all about it,” said
Henderson, rising from his chair and hurriedly
pacing the room. “If he won’t go
overboard he must be locked up; my luck
and everything else depend upon it. I will<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
go out now and see what Scanlan has to say
about it, for I am determined that I will not
put up with him any longer.”</p>

<p>Scanlan was the friend he had left an hour
or so before, and when found he didn’t have
the money to enable him to go on with that
speculation. There were few Hendersons in
the field for him to call upon, and they were
as hard up as he was.</p>

<p>“I guess the land will have to go to somebody
else,” said he, as he described his ill
luck. “I want just five hundred dollars, and
nobody seems to have it.”</p>

<p>“I could get it, if it were not for my
brother,” said Henderson; and when he
spoke the word “brother” he fairly hissed it
through his teeth. Scanlan looked up in surprise.
“Have I forgotten to tell you that old
Bob invariably speaks of that little snipe as
my brother?” he continued. “He has been
with him now for four years, and he thinks
that I can get used to calling him by a relationship
that really never existed.”</p>

<p>“How old is the boy, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Seven years old. Old Bob took him when<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
he was only three. I only wish the Indians
had come down on them and massacred the
last one of the lot. Not old Bob, of course,
for I am indebted to him for a pocketful of
rocks, but that young one I wish I had never
seen.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what his pocketful of rocks
has got to do with you,” said Scanlan.</p>

<p>“Neither do I. I do think,” added Henderson,
as though he was considering the
matter for the first time, “that if I would go
home and behave myself, and wait until the
old man dies, I could really get hold of some
of his money, but how much would I get?
Not twenty thousand, and that isn’t enough
to buy an oyster supper.”</p>

<p>“How much is the old man worth?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. A cool million.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Scanlan. “And are
you going to stay back and let that boy cheat
you out of it? If you do I shall never be
sorry for you.”</p>

<p>“That’s is just what I don’t want to do,
and I came down here to talk to you about
kidnapping him and putting him under lock<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
and key,” continued Henderson, looking all
around to make sure that no one overheard
him. “I say let him be locked up at once.”</p>

<p>“Now you are talking,” said Scanlan. “If
you had decided on that several years ago you
would have had no trouble; but now I tell
you it is going to be uphill work. We’ve got
the tutor to overcome, and that is going to be
all that we two can do. Now, what do you
propose?”</p>

<p>A long conversation followed, and the substance
was that the matter was left entirely
in the hands of his friend Scanlan. Henderson
had never been in the habit of defying
the police by engaging in any kidnapping
schemes, and he did not propose to begin now.
He wanted the boy got rid of, when and how
he didn’t care, so long as no effort was made
against his life. That was too dangerous.
And there, we may add, the thing rested for a
whole year, until one day Henderson heard
something in a few moments’ talk with the
tutor, who had waited outside while his pupil
was in a store making some purchases, that
set him post haste after Scanlan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[209]</span></p>

<p>“The dog is dead now,” said he, drawing
Scanlan into a doorway where they could talk
without being overheard, “and I don’t know
whether to be glad or sorry over it. My
brother is going to Texas!”</p>

<p>“To Texas?” exclaimed Scanlan. “What
in the world should take him into that far-off
region?”</p>

<p>“He had a relative down there engaged in
the cattle business, and he has died leaving
his property to old Bob. Don’t it beat the
world how some fellows can get along without
lifting their hands? Now, if he had left those
cattle to me who stand so much in need of
them&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If that boy goes to Texas he’ll be out of
reach of you,” interrupted Scanlan.</p>

<p>“Yes; but see what danger he’ll be in.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that he will be in any danger&mdash;more
than he is here,” said Scanlan.
“Remember that if he stays there long
enough to get acquainted he will have any
number of rifles to back him up.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Why, supposing his father dies and<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
leaves no will. It would put you to some
trouble to prove that you are next of kin.
You see your names are different. If they
made up their minds that he was the heir, it
would be good-by to you.”</p>

<p>“And you believe it would be best to kidnap
him very soon?” asked Henderson, his
courage all leaving him.</p>

<p>“Certainly I do! If he goes down there
you are a poor man for your lifetime. Now
is the chance. I tell you I would not miss it
for anything!”</p>

<p>This brought the matter squarely home to
Henderson, and he decided that he would
take that night to sleep upon it. He rolled
and tossed on his bed without ever closing his
eyes in slumber, and when morning came he
had made up his mind to do something.</p>

<p>“Scanlan will have to do it all,” said he,
and his compressed lips showed that he had
looked at the matter in all its bearings. “I
will keep just behind him and show him the
room where the boy sleeps, and he can throw
the quilt over him and secure him without
any help from me. Then if that old tutor of<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
his jumps in on us, why I will get out of the
way. But I must leave my way of escape
clear.”</p>

<p>Henderson carried out his programme by
going to the bank, drawing out his money, and
depositing it somewhere about his person.
Then he packed his trunk as if for a long
journey, and then told Scanlan that he was
ready for business.</p>

<p>“I knew that was the decision you would
come to, so I got the carriage and made it all
right with the driver,” said Scanlan. “I
have got an extension bit, which is about the
only thing we need, to enable us to get in
through the basement door. Now, Cliff, how
much am I going to get for this? I do all the
work and you stand by and look on. I ought
to have a considerable sum for that.”</p>

<p>“Why, I guess what I am to give the
doctor&mdash;&mdash;” began Henderson.</p>

<p>“Not much,” said Scanlan, with a laugh.
“What you will give the doctor won’t faze
me. Say a tenth of what you make.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness!” stammered Henderson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[212]</span></p>

<p>“I have got the paper here, it is all drawn
up, and I guess it is all right,” continued
Scanlan, drawing a folded document from his
inside pocket. “Just run your eye over
that.”</p>

<p>“A hundred thousand!” gasped Henderson.</p>

<p>“That isn’t a drop in the bucket to what
you will have if you succeed,” said Scanlan
coolly. “You will see that the paper says
‘if successful.’ If you don’t succeed in the
job, why that is my lookout. If you do, I
shall want the money. If the arrangement
doesn’t suit you, get somebody else to try
his hand.”</p>

<p>That was just what Henderson was afraid
of, and things had gone too far for him to
back out. He felt as though he was signing
his death warrant when he was affixing his
signature to the document, but when it was
done the writing did not look much like his
bold penmanship.</p>

<p>“So far so good,” said Scanlan, coolly surveying
the signature. “But you are a little
nervous, Cliff. Now you keep that tutor off<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
me and I will get the boy. You meet me here
at ten o’clock, and when morning comes that
fellow will be under lock and key.”</p>

<p>“I have done it,” said Henderson, going
out on the street and wending his way toward
his brother’s house. “I have gone too far to
back out. Here I have gone and signed a
paper and placed it in the hands of that man
Scanlan, and he can use it on me at a moment’s
warning. He’s a desperate fellow. I
wish I felt as certain of success as he does.”</p>

<p>Somebody has said that when a man is
going to the bad he finds everything greased
for the occasion; that is, he finds it easy
enough to go down hill; but almost impossible
for him to get back. I am not well enough
posted in literature to know who it was that
said it, but perhaps some of you boys who are
fresh from your books may be able to name
the person. Henderson found it so, and it all
dated from the moment he signed that paper.
He was afraid to back out now, and so he must
go on. He walked by his brother’s house
once or twice, and then went back to his
hotel. He didn’t eat any supper, and he<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
didn’t want any; but when it came near
time for him to meet Scanlan he stepped
into a store and bought a heavy oak stick,
which he thought would be strong enough to
floor the tutor or anybody else that took a
hand in rescuing the boy, and pronounced himself
ready for the business. There were still
three hours for them to pass in some way, for
Scanlan did not think it safe to make a move
before one o’clock, and the time seemed to
slip away before they knew it. They found
the carriage right where Scanlan said they
would, and in a few minutes were set down
within a few doors of Mr. Davenport’s house.
When they got out the hack-driver thought it
time to speak about his money.</p>

<p>“Look here!” said he; “which one of you
gentlemen is a-going to pay me a hundred
dollars for this trip? Kidnapping a sane
person and taking him off to a lunatic
asylum&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My dear sir, kidnapping is something
we don’t have any hand in at all,” said
Scanlan. “We are going to take this fellow
out of the house with the full consent of<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
his father, but we don’t want his aunts to
know anything about it. The hundred dollars
are all right. This man is a detective,
and will pay you when we get the passenger
to the asylum. Are you satisfied?”</p>

<p>The hack-driver had nothing further to say.
All he wanted to know was who would give
him his money when the trip was over. He
mounted to his box, being instructed to keep
himself within hailing distance, and the two
kept on toward Mr. Davenport’s residence.
All was dark and silent within, except the
light that was kept burning in the tutor’s
room.</p>

<p>“We have got to keep out of that,” said
Henderson, pointing toward the window. “If
we allow ourselves to come within reach of
it I shall be recognized; then good-by to
me.”</p>

<p>“Well, we must look out for that,” said
Scanlan, who did not feel any more fear than
if he was sitting down to his supper. “Keep
close beside me, and be ready to knock the
tutor down if he takes a hand in the rumpus.
That’s all you have to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[216]</span></p>

<p>In a few minutes they reached the basement
door, where they were free from interruption,
and Scanlan, producing his extension bit, went
to work in earnest. He first cut out a circular
opening in the door above the bolt, then
thrust his hand in and cautiously removed
the fastenings, and the door swung open.
They entered and Scanlan closed the door
behind him.</p>

<p>“I think you had better leave it open,”
said Henderson, who trembled as if he was
seized with a sudden attack of the ague.
“We might be discovered.”</p>

<p>“In that case we’ll have something to
light us out,” said Scanlan. “But be sure
you kick over the blaze before you go
out.”</p>

<p>With the words Scanlan took from his
pocket a small piece of candle, which he
lighted and stood upon the table, embedded in
some of its own grease. Then he stopped and
looked around him. The house was silent as
if it had been deserted, and having satisfied
himself on this point, Scanlan motioned for
Henderson to lead the way up the stairs.<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
The steps were carpeted, and moreover, being
shod with rubbers, the men gave out no sound
as they ascended to the first floor, the leader
easily finding and opening all doors that
barred his progress. That one lock passed
at the basement door had opened the way
for them.</p>

<p>At length they came to the front hall, and
here some more strategy was made use of.
Henderson carefully unlocked the door and
placed the key on the outside, and then cautiously
led the way up the second stairs to the
floor above. He stopped every once in a while
to listen, but he heard nothing suspicious,
and presently pushed open a door that gave
entrance into the room in which the little
boy was sleeping. With a motion of his
hand, Henderson pointed him out, and then
moved through the room to take a look at the
tutor. He lay upon his back with his arms
extended over his head, revealing muscles
that made Henderson tremble. Something, I
don’t know what it was, went through the
tutor all of a sudden, and he started up in
alarm to find a strange face in his door<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
He gazed at it a moment, and then thrust
his hand under his pillow. When it came
out it had a revolver in its grasp. Henderson
took one look at it and turned and took
to his heels.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">HE DOES NOT SUCCEED.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">“Halt! Clifford Henderson, I know
you!” shouted the tutor, in a stentorian
voice, as he threw off the bedclothes
and started on a furious race for the intruder.
“I know you, and you had better halt.”</p>

<p>He supposed, of course, that the object of
his visit was robbery&mdash;and had no intention of
using one of the cartridges in his revolver&mdash;until
he came to his bedroom door and there
saw Scanlan, who had thrown a quilt over the
boy’s head and started on a run after Henderson,
and then he stopped as if somebody had
aimed a blow at him. Then he saw that
abduction was a part of Henderson’s scheme,
and in an instant his revolver was covering
Scanlan’s head.</p>

<p>“Put that boy back on the bed where he
belongs,” said the tutor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[220]</span></p>

<p>Scanlan took one look at the revolver, and
at the man who held it, and readily obeyed.</p>

<p>“Now throw the quilt off his head, so that
he can breathe,” said the tutor; and the readiness
with which Scanlan complied disarmed
the tutor, who lowered his revolver.</p>

<p>This was the move that Scanlan was waiting
for. In an instant he dropped on all-fours,
shot under the out-stretched hand that held
the deadly weapon, caught the tutor around
the legs and tumbled him over on his back.
It was all done with the greatest ease, and
when the tutor scrambled to his feet Scanlan
had disappeared. He ran hastily to the head
of the stairs, and he saw Scanlan’s coat-tails
vanishing as he made his way to the basement.
He had tried the front door, but Henderson
had gone out there and had locked the
door behind him. The tutor tried the front
basement door also, and in the meantime
Scanlan had already gone out at that very
door, not forgetting to knock over the candle
in his hurried flight. That was the last they
saw of Scanlan. By the time the tutor had
returned to his room he found Mr. Davenport<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
there, sitting on the bed and talking to
Bob.</p>

<p>“Why, this looks like a case of abduction,”
said Mr. Davenport, when the tutor
came in. “Did I hear you say that you
recognized Clifford Henderson as one of the
assailants?”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought it was he, but I might
have been mistaken,” replied the tutor, who
did not want to say anything that would add
to the old man’s fears.</p>

<p>“Don’t deceive me. I heard your voice
plain enough, and that was what you said.
Never mind, Bob. We’ll soon be far enough
away from him, and able to enjoy life in our
own way. Now I will go back to bed. No;
the men had to take themselves off without
getting anything,” he added, to the servants
who came flocking into the room at that
moment. “I wish you would find out where
they got in and shut the window or door,
whichever it is. Clifford Henderson! That
man isn’t going to let me forget him, is he?”
he muttered to himself. “I must see him and
tell him that if he does not leave town I shall<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
have him arrested. I shall remember the
tutor for this.”</p>

<p>And in the meantime where was Clifford
Henderson? You know that before he went
into this business he drew his money from the
bank and packed his trunk for a long journey.
He saw the need of it now. He never
travelled faster than he did when he rushed
from that door. He saw Scanlan in the act of
lifting the boy from the bed after throwing
the quilt about him, but did not stop to speak
to him. He made for the stairs, two jumps
took him to the front door, and paying no
heed to the friend he had left behind in a bad
scrape, he ran through and locked the door
behind him. And he had heard his name
mentioned, too!</p>

<p>“I declare I am done for now,” muttered
Henderson, as he took his best pace down the
sidewalk, utterly forgetful that there was a
carriage in waiting for him, “and the next
thing will be to avoid the police that my
brother sets after me. For he will arrest me
as sure as I live. Scanlan will be arrested
too, and there is that paper I gave him with<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
my name signed to it. Ow! <em>Ow!</em> Don’t I
wish that everybody was in danger the same
as I am?”</p>

<p>If Henderson hadn’t been so frightened that
he was unable to look behind him, he would
have seen Scanlan come out of the basement
door and take his flight in another direction;
but Henderson couldn’t think of anything but
the tutor’s stentorian voice. “I know you
and you had better halt!” It seemed to ring
in his ears louder than ever the farther he got
from the house, so that he increased his pace,
and the first thing he knew ran slap into the
arms of a policeman, who happened at that
moment to come around the corner.</p>

<p>“Hallo, here!” cried the officer. “Where
are you going in such a hurry?”</p>

<p>“Do you know whether or not the <em>Commonwealth</em>
has sailed from this port yet?” asked
Henderson.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t!” answered the officer.</p>

<p>“Well, my trunk is at my hotel, already
packed, and I am in haste to catch her. I
hope I shall get there before she sails.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take a carriage?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[224]</span></p>

<p>“I will just as soon as I get to my hotel.
Which way is the Planter’s House from
here?”</p>

<p>“Go down this street to the next corner,
and then go five blocks. Good luck to you!”</p>

<p>“That thing is done easy enough, but the
next policeman that stops me will be worse,”
said Henderson, continuing on his way.
“He’ll say there is a signature waiting for
you that I want you to explain, and how will
I get out of it? Well, we’ll wait until that
time comes. I must do the best I can to
escape now.”</p>

<p>Henderson knew where the Planter’s House
was as well as anybody, but he followed the
policeman’s directions. By the time he
reached his destination he was pretty well
winded. He engaged a carriage at the door,
paid his bill at the hotel, and saw his trunk
perched up beside the driver.</p>

<p>“Go fast now, for I have not a minute to
waste,” said Henderson. “Get me down
there before that steamer sails and I will give
you two dollars.”</p>

<p>In an hour more Henderson was snug in bed<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
and listening to the puffing of the engines
which were bearing him down the river. He
had taken passage on a little boat that was
bound for New Orleans and had the room all
to himself. In spite of his joy over his escape
he could not help feeling bitter toward Scanlan.
Why had he signed that paper? Scanlan
would be sure to be apprehended,&mdash;he
couldn’t get away from that pistol,&mdash;and he
would be searched at the police court, and the
whole thing would come out against him.</p>

<p>“Never mind; he’s in a bad fix,” said Henderson,
pounding a pillow into shape to fit his
head. “And I don’t know but that I am in a
worse one. I hope they will send him up so
that I will never see him again. And then
what will my friends think?”</p>

<p>Filled with such thoughts as these we may
readily conceive that Henderson’s journey
down the river was not a pleasant one, and it
was only after they had left Cairo, and were
fairly afloat for New Orleans, that he recovered
his usual spirits. He remained in New
Orleans for a single day, and then took passage
for Galveston, from which place he went<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
to Austin. He deposited his money there in
the bank, secured a second rate boarding
house, and settled down to see what the fates
had in store for him.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, I am a free man at
last!” said Henderson. “I have not heard a
word from St. Louis since I left there, but I
only hope Scanlan has got his just dues.
And here is the place Bob was going to come.
Well, I’ll keep clear of him. I hope I may
never hear of him again.”</p>

<p>As the years rolled by and nothing was
heard about his attempted abduction of Bob,
or of Scanlan either, Henderson began to
think that the matter was forgotten. By
behaving himself Henderson made many
friends in Texas, for it is not always the good
who have blessings showered upon them
except in story books. He made an honest
effort at reform, and it is possible that he
might have succeeded if it hadn’t been for
one thing. He was a speculator in cattle,&mdash;he
never was known as anything else,&mdash;and he
finally got into the habit of riding out on the
prairie, taking no money with him, to see<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
what he could buy. For Texas was a new
State, we had only just got through the war
with Mexico, and everybody who had any
wrong done him, or had got into difficulty
with his fellow-man, came to Texas to begin
over again. Anyone, too, who found the law
too strict for him in older communities, could
come here and get out of the reach of it.</p>

<p>On one occasion Henderson started out
alone to visit some ranches he had heard of,
but which seldom drove any of their cattle to
market. It was just about the time the
drought was commencing and Henderson was
anxious to get beyond reach of it, out on the
plains where water was abundant and grass
plenty. If he could once reach that spot he
was sure that he could make something nice
out of his cattle; but the trouble was the
drought spread all over that part of Texas.
He was mounted on an old dilapidated horse,
carried his revolver strapped around his waist,
and had but three or four dollars in his
pocket&mdash;not enough to pay anybody for the
trouble of robbing him. But after he had
been on the journey for two weeks, during<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
which time he met one or two parties who
would just as soon rob him as not, he came to
the conclusion that he had undertaken his
ride for nothing. There was an abundance
of cattle for sale, but the difficulty was they
would not bring any more in Austin than he
was willing to pay on the spot, and one day
he turned around with the intention of going
back, when he saw a horseman on a distant
swell coming toward him. As he evidently
wanted to communicate with him, Henderson
rode on to meet him.</p>

<p>“You won’t get any more than your
trouble if you try to rob me,” said Henderson.
“I’ll wait and see what he wants. Perhaps
he knows of some cattle around here that I
can buy.”</p>

<p>“How-dy, pilgrim,” said the horseman
when he came up. “Have you been travelling
fur to-day?”</p>

<p>“I have been out ever since daylight this
morning,” said Henderson. “Why do you
ask?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I didn’t know but you had seen
some cattle bearing the mark of bar Y. R. as<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
you came along. Haven’t seen any, have
you? There is probably a hundred head got
away from me night before last, and I can’t
find hide nor hair of them. They have gone
off in search of grass and water. We haven’t
got any here to speak of.”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t seen any, and I may as well
turn around and go back. This drought extends
over the whole of the country.”</p>

<p>“Bless you, yes! We got word the other
day from a ranch twenty miles the other side
of us that they are packing up and getting
ready to go to Trinity.”</p>

<p>“Why, the farmers won’t allow that. They
will shoot the last beef you have.”</p>

<p>“Well, it will take a right smart deal of
ammunition to do that,” said the horseman,
with a grin. “’Cause why? there will be about
seventy-five thousand head, mebbe more, that
will have to be shot; and when the farmers
are doing that, what do you suppose we’ll be
doing?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you will be shooting too. Do
you own these cattle?”</p>

<p>“No; they belong to a man named Davenport<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
who lives over that way about twenty
miles.”</p>

<p>“Davenport!” exclaimed Henderson, who
was taken all aback.</p>

<p>“Them’s the words I spoke, pilgrim,” said
the horseman, looking at Henderson in surprise.
“Maybe you know the man?”</p>

<p>“Is he Robert Davenport?” enquired Henderson,
scarcely believing that he had heard
aright.</p>

<p>“I believe that is what they call him sometimes.”</p>

<p>“And he’s got a little boy named Bob?”</p>

<p>“Well, he aint so very little now. He was
little when he came here, but he’s growed
to be right smart. Maybe you know the
man?”</p>

<p>“Did he come here from St. Louis?”</p>

<p>“Look a-here, pilgrim; suppose you let me
ask some questions. How do you happen to
know so much about the man? He’s my employer,
and a mighty good man he is.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon! but when I heard you
speak his name I concluded that I knew him.
I knew a man of that name once who was<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
almost dead of consumption. But of course
it can’t be the same one.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, between you and me,” said the
cowboy, considerably mollified by this explanation,
“he is as good as dead already.
Sometimes, when I get up in the morning, I
look around to see if he is all right, and there
he is sitting on the porch. He gets up before
I do.”</p>

<p>“Bob hasn’t got his tutor with him,
has he?”</p>

<p>“His which?” asked the horseman.</p>

<p>“His private teacher,” explained Henderson.
“He used to have one sticking to his
heels wherever he went.”</p>

<p>“No; he’s alone. You will ride on and
see him? It is only a matter of twenty
miles.”</p>

<p>“No; I can’t. I will come out and see
him at some future time. My business just
now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now, pilgrim, you asked a good many
questions regarding that man. I want to
know if he has been doing something up in
the States.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[232]</span></p>

<p>“Not a thing! Not a solitary thing, I
assure you.”</p>

<p>“’Cause if he has, I won’t let no man set
there on his horse and tell me that,” continued
the horseman, growing sullen again.
“He’s as fair and square a man as there is.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t been doing anything wrong.
You may mention my name when you get
home, and see if he doesn’t back up my
story.”</p>

<p>“What did you say your name was?”</p>

<p>“Clifford Henderson. I can easy tell him
that, because if he has let so many years go
without arresting me he’ll not begin now,”
said he to himself. “This man doesn’t know
where I live and I won’t tell him.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you haven’t seen them cattle, I’ll
go,” said the horseman, turning his nag about.
“I’d feel a heap safer if you would go on with
me&mdash;but I tell you, you would have to explain
why you asked so many questions. So long!”</p>

<p>I may interrupt my story here long enough
to say that when the horseman went home he
reported his accidental meeting with Henderson,
together with the questions he asked, at<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
which Mr. Davenport was greatly alarmed,
although he tried not to show it. That very
night worked a change in Bob’s fortunes
which he did not like. Up to this time he
had been permitted to go as he pleased among
the cattlemen, who all liked him and did their
best to teach him, but now he was obliged to
remain indoors, or at least within reach of his
father’s voice. His father couldn’t bear to
have him out of his sight. The very next day
the will was drawn up; and although Mr.
Davenport frequently promised himself that
the first time he went to Austin he would go
through the process of adopting Bob, so as to
give him the whole of his money in case anything
happened to him, he never got beyond
the sound of his own dinner horn. It was a
terrible thing for the invalid to reflect that he
had brought Bob up to believe that he was his
own son, and somehow he could not straighten
it out.</p>

<p>Henderson was on nettles when he rode
away from the horseman. He knew that his
brother was somewhere in Texas, and he
hoped he was on a cattle ranch far out of<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
reach of him; but the way the horseman
pronounced the name fairly took his breath
away.</p>

<p>“Of all the men that I ever expected to
hear of, that Davenport is the beat!” said
Henderson, throwing his reins upon his
horse’s neck and shoving his hands into his
pockets. “I don’t believe I have thought of
him for six months, or if I did, I thought of
him as dead, and here he has turned up when
I least expected it. By George! all my
desire to possess his wealth comes back to
me; but how I am to get it I don’t know.
That boy has plenty of rifles to back him up,
as Scanlan said he would.”</p>

<p>This was the one thing of which I spoke that
effectually destroyed all Henderson’s idea of
making a better man of himself. It was easy
enough to be good when temptation was not
thrown in his way, but when temptation came,
he was no better than anybody else. He rode
along for two hours, thinking over Bob’s
habits, and wondering if it would be possible
for him to steal the boy away, as he had been
on the point of doing in St. Louis, and not<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
until the sun began to set did he look around
for a camping-place.</p>

<p>“I wish Scanlan was here now,” said he.
“I am sure he would be apt to think of something.
There’s three men,” he added, shading
his eyes with his hand and gazing toward
a belt of post-oaks in which he intended to
make his camp. “I wonder if they are good-natured,
or if they mean to go through my
pockets? Time will tell.”</p>

<p>When he first discovered the three men in
the timber two of them were lying down, and
the other was moving about as if making
preparations for supper. One saw his approach
and called the attention of the others
to it, and then all got up and looked at him.
Evidently the men were not inclined to trust
strangers, for he saw that one of them, whom
he took to be spokesman, raised up without
anything in his hands, while the others stood
with their rifles in the hollow of their arms.
Henderson thought this looked a little suspicious,
but kept on and in a few minutes
was close enough to the camp to accost the
men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[236]</span></p>

<p>“How do you do, strangers?” said he.</p>

<p>“How-dy, pilgrim,” said the spokesman.</p>

<p>“Have you got room in your camp for
another person?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! There’s plenty of room round
here.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got some things in my haversack that
may assist you in making out your supper,”
said Henderson.</p>

<p>“Well, alight and hitch,” said the spokesman.
“There’s plenty of room for your
horse here too.”</p>

<p>Henderson dismounted and removed the
saddle from his horse, the men with the rifles
regarding him suspiciously. When he had
thrown his saddle down by the fire, he coolly
unhitched his revolver and flung it down beside
it; whereupon the men with the rifles
drew a long breath of relief, and deposited
their weapons beside the trees where they had
taken them from. Henderson noticed this,
and said, as he made his lariat fast to his
horse’s neck:</p>

<p>“You seem to be on the lookout for something.
I am a trader.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[237]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, you are, are you?” said the spokesman.</p>

<p>“Yes. And I have only got a few dollars
in my pocket, so that it would be useless for
anybody to think of robbing me. I came out
here for the purpose of getting some cattle,
but I found that the drought was ahead of me.
The stock isn’t worth what their hides and
tallow would cost. Now,” he added, having
driven down his picket pin and seated himself
near the fire, “I’d like to know why all you
Texans pronounce me a ‘pilgrim’ as soon as
you see me. Is there anything about me that
reminds you of the States?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes. The way you sit your horse is
against you. A Texan does not sit bent over,
with his hands on the horn of his saddle, as if
he feared that the next step would pitch him
overboard. And then those gloves. A Texan
doesn’t wear them.”</p>

<p>“And I have been here almost eight years,”
said Henderson. “I guess I shall have to
ride a little more in order to get accustomed
to the customs of the country. What did you
say your name was?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[238]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t say,” returned the spokesman.</p>

<p>“My name is Henderson,” replied the guest,
who wished most heartily that he had gone
somewhere else. He didn’t like the way the
spokesman answered his last question.</p>

<p>“My name is&mdash;&mdash; Which one do you
want?”</p>

<p>“Why, the one you go by, of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, the name that I go by just now is
Coyote Bill,” said the man, pushing his
spurred heels a little closer to the fire. “You
have heard of me, I reckon?”</p>

<p>Henderson was startled to hear this name.
He had heard of him a good many times while
in Austin, and had never expected to meet
him in this unceremonious manner. He knew
that he was in the power of a desperado of the
worst sort.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">HENDERSON MEETS COYOTE BILL.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">“Yes, that is the name I go by now,”
said Coyote Bill, grinning when he
saw Henderson’s expression of astonishment.
“What my other name is no one in this
country knows. Whenever you hear that
name spoken you will know what I look like.
I came to this country the same as you did.”</p>

<p>“The same as I did?” echoed Henderson,
his surprise increasing. “What do you mean
by that?”</p>

<p>“Why, you got into some trouble up there
with the police and had to skip, that’s what
I mean. A man of your education does not
come down to this country of his own free
will.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a fact,” said Henderson,
breathing easy again. A desperate scheme
had occurred to him, suggested by the outlaw’s
last words. He was wishing for Scanlan<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
all the time, thinking that he would be likely
to propose something by which he could
possess himself of his brother’s wealth, and
right here was the man who, by a little
management, could be induced to act Scanlan’s
part. He would try him at any rate,
but he wanted first to see how much Coyote
Bill knew about him.</p>

<p>“Are these all the men you have in your
band?” asked Henderson, at length.</p>

<p>“No,” laughed Bill, as if the very idea
amused him. “I’ve got one or two more scattered
around on the plains somewhere.”</p>

<p>“That means that you have thirty or forty
more,” said Henderson.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got some in Austin, and that’s
where they have seen you. Although I had
never seen you before, I knew you the
moment you hove in sight.”</p>

<p>Again Henderson breathed easy. He knew
he hadn’t said anything about his kidnapping
scheme in Austin, or anywhere else, that
Coyote Bill could have got hold of it, and
consequently Bill was just guessing at his
reason for being in Texas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[241]</span></p>

<p>“Who are those men? What did I say in
their presence that led them to guess why I
had come down here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you said enough! I aint going to tell
you just what you said, for fear that you
would know those men when you get back.
Is the man around here that you have got
anything against?”</p>

<p>“I will speak to you after a while,” said
Henderson, turning his gaze toward the rest
of the men at the fire.</p>

<p>“Oh, you may speak freely here! I never
go into anything without their consent. It’s
share and share alike here. But if you would
rather speak to me alone, why it is all right.
Have you got supper ready?”</p>

<p>The man appealed to nodded, and pointed
to a pile of bacon and corn bread that was
waiting for them. It was such a supper as
Henderson, in his St. Louis home, would have
turned up his nose at, but he was ready for it
now. During the meal but little was said,
and Henderson, out of the corner of his eye,
took a good survey of the man that everybody
called Coyote Bill. He didn’t look like such<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
a desperate fellow, by any means, and all
the men who had had experience with him
described him as a very different person.
This proved that Bill did not always lead his
bands, but gave the movement into somebody
else’s hands, and appeared only when out of
reach of the settlers. He was as neat as a new
pin, and showed by every move he made that
he had been well brought up. After supper
he lighted his pipe and motioned to Henderson
to follow him out on the plains. When
out of reach of everybody he threw himself
down on the grass and invited Henderson to
do the same.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” said he, “I am ready to hear
all your plans.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I have got any,” said
Henderson.</p>

<p>“Yes, you have,” said Coyote Bill, in a
tone that showed he was not in a mood to
argue the matter. “A man needn’t come
around here with such a face as you have
got on you and tell me anything like that.
What was the reason you did not go on
and see Davenport? I saw you talking with<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
a cowboy of his not more than three hours
ago.”</p>

<p>“Where were you?” asked Henderson,
more astonished than ever.</p>

<p>“We were just behind a neighboring swell,
not more than half a mile away. Your names
are not alike, but still you must be some kin
to Davenport. What relationship are you?”</p>

<p>“I am his half brother.”</p>

<p>“That makes you next of kin, don’t it?
Well, now, if that man dies, who is going to
inherit his property?”</p>

<p>“I am, if it were not for that little nuisance
he has picked up somewhere. You see it was
just this way.”</p>

<p>With this introduction Henderson went on
and gave Coyote Bill a full history of the boy
Mr. Davenport had adopted in the mines; or
rather, he intended to adopt him, but he
didn’t do it. He had brought him up from
a little boy to think his property was all his
own, giving no heed to the half brother who
might want some of it.</p>

<p>“And when I asked him for a little
money&mdash;five hundred dollars were all I<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
wanted&mdash;he got up on his ear and said I
couldn’t have it. That made me mad, I tell
you, and I left his house for good.”</p>

<p>“And never went into it again?” enquired
Coyote Bill.</p>

<p>“Yes, I went into it once more,” said Henderson,
thinking he might as well tell the
truth, now that he was about it. “I went in
and made an effort to steal the boy. I didn’t
get caught at it, but my partner did, and I
reckon he’s serving the penalty before this
time.”</p>

<p>“What were you going to do with him?”
asked Coyote Bill, and it was plain that he
had a big respect for Henderson.</p>

<p>“I was going to put him in a lunatic asylum.
I was going to keep him there until he
became of age, and then get him to sign his
money over to me. I tell you he would have
done it before he had been there two weeks.”</p>

<p>“And he just as sane as you are?” said
Bill. “Didn’t you know that the authorities
would have turned&mdash;&mdash; By the way, how
much is the old man worth?”</p>

<p>“He’s worth a million of dollars. I know<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
that he would have turned the place upside
down in the effort to find Bob, but I tell
you I would have been willing to risk it.”</p>

<p>“A million dollars! And you want to get
hold of some of that money?”</p>

<p>“I tell you I want to get hold of all of it,”
said Henderson. “It is mine, and I don’t see
why he should want that little nuisance to
cheat me out of it. The thing would be safe
enough if I could get somebody to trust. I
want him to go to the old man’s ranch and
find out where he keeps his bonds hidden.
It would be no trouble at all for him to steal
them.”</p>

<p>This was all Henderson found it necessary
for him to say on that subject; Coyote Bill
“caught on” immediately. He understood
that Henderson wanted him to go to the
ranch and steal those bonds. He arose to a
sitting posture and smoked audibly while he
meditated.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that that could be easily
done,” said he.</p>

<p>“Why, I know it could! If I was as I
used to be in my brother’s house, I would<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
gain the whole thing in a week. But the
trouble is I threatened him when I left. I
told him that if Bob ever lived to become his
heir, I would follow him up and make him
know what it was to be in want as I was at
that moment.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll try it,” said Bill.</p>

<p>“You will?” asked Henderson, so overjoyed
that he could scarcely speak plainly.
“I didn’t suppose that you would go there
yourself, but thought that maybe you could
find some man to send in your place.”</p>

<p>“I would rather go myself, because I will
know that everything has been done. You
see, there isn’t one man in ten who knows
me. I could go there and pass myself off for
a miner.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea! The old man has been
there, and you could tell him what you
pleased. Have you ever been in the mines?”</p>

<p>“No. I am as close to them as I care to
get. If I find that strategy won’t work, I
suppose I could put the Indians on them.”</p>

<p>“Indians?” said Henderson.</p>

<p>“Certainly. I was on my way to the reservation<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
when I saw you talking to the old
man’s cowboy. You see, I don’t find much
work to do, and I am going there to rest up
a bit. This drought will soon be over, and
then I shall have more than I can do.”</p>

<p>“What do you call your business, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Oh, stealing cattle. I take them to a
little fertile spot in the Staked Plains, kill
them for their hides and tallow, and give the
meat to the Indians. I am chief of about a
hundred men, and they will go their lengths
for me.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! I didn’t know that.”</p>

<p>“You see that I can easily get the money,
or whatever it is that he is keeping from you.
Now, I want to know how much I am to get
for this. Say a half a million.”</p>

<p>“I will give you half of whatever I make.
Can anything be fairer than that? It may be
more and it may be less than half a million.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s fair. Now let’s go back to
the fire and see what the men think of this.
You had better go to bed, and we’ll see how
it looks in the morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[248]</span></p>

<p>Henderson could scarcely sleep at all that
night, and when he did he awoke to find that
Coyote Bill and his men were still discussing
the subject. The method of stealing the
bonds instead of stealing the boy promised
much better than his original scheme, for he
would have no hand in it. Coyote Bill would
be alone in the matter, and if he should be
detected and could not be prevailed upon to
tell who his accomplice was&mdash;&mdash; Ah! That
was something he hadn’t spoken to Bill about.
In the morning he would broach that subject,
and tell Bill never to mention his name. If
he did, all his hope of success would be gone.
He finally fell asleep and awoke to find breakfast
waiting for him. Bill greeted him with
a good-morning, and immediately referred to
their last night’s conversation.</p>

<p>“Well, I am going to try it,” said he. “I
have never stolen any of Davenport’s cattle,
and I don’t suppose there is anyone on his
place who knows me.”</p>

<p>“If you are caught, don’t mention my
name,” said Henderson. “He knows me, and
he don’t expect any good of me, either.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[249]</span></p>

<p>“If you knew me, pilgrim, you wouldn’t
mention that at all,” said Bill; and anybody
could see that he was growing mad about it.
“I shall not call the name of Henderson once
while I am there. If anybody says anything
to me about you I shall say I don’t know
you.”</p>

<p>After breakfast Bill shook Henderson by
the hand and started and walked away. He
took nothing with him except his brace of
revolvers and an old dilapidated blanket,
which he slung over his shoulder. He left his
rifle and horse in charge of his men, who were
to bring them to him at some future time,
Henderson didn’t know when or where it was.
Bill didn’t exchange any plans with Henderson,
for he had made up his mind what he
wanted to do and he didn’t care to have anyone
know it. Henderson gazed at him in surprise
as he walked away.</p>

<p>“There’s a man who is going into trouble,”
said he. “I could have given him some
things that I think would have helped him
out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you lose no sleep worryin’ about<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
him,” said one of the men. “He knows what
he is going to do. Now you can find your
way back, can’t you? We have got to leave
you here.”</p>

<p>Yes, Henderson could get along now all
right, and he gladly parted with the men,
after dividing his corn meal and bacon with
them, for he was anxious to get away by himself
and think the matter over. He hadn’t
known what happiness was before in a long
while.</p>

<p>“If one of the men from whom I have just
parted,” said he, as soon as he was out of
hearing, “had told me that he was the chief
of a hundred men who would go their lengths
for him, I should have believed him; but
that is a queer thing for that neat-looking
fellow to say. How easily that villain fell in
with my plans! If I had been going there
knowing what he does&mdash;&mdash; Whew! I believe
I should have got some advice from somebody.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Coyote Bill walked along toward
Mr. Davenport’s ranch, keeping a lookout for
horsemen who were on the watch for stray<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
cattle, whom he intended to dodge, and revolving
in his mind certain plans for stealing
the bonds; for be it known that he put
implicit faith in Henderson’s word. No man
could come to him and talk as earnestly as he
did when there was nothing behind it. He
tramped all that day, found a camp at night
in a belt of timber with which the country
was thickly interspersed, laid down without a
fire, and at ten o’clock reached his destination.
He was really foot-sore and weary
when he got there, for walking so far was
something to which he was not accustomed,
and was glad to see the man for whom he was
looking sitting on the porch.</p>

<p>“Good-day to you, sir!” said Coyote
Bill, lifting his hat. “Is this Mr. Faber’s
ranch?”</p>

<p>“Come up and sit down,” replied Mr.
Davenport. “You have travelled far and you
look completely exhausted. Faber! I don’t
know such a man as that. He can’t have a
ranch anywhere about here.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Bill. “I believe I
am tired, and if it will suit you will sit down<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
for a while. May I make bold to ask for
something to eat?”</p>

<p>“Eat? Yes, you can have all you want.
Bob, hunt up the cook and get something.
Have you travelled far, sir?”</p>

<p>“About a hundred miles, afoot and alone.”</p>

<p>“I guess that a drink of water would help
you. We haven’t got much, but what we’ve
got you are welcome to. Bob,” he added, as
the boy came back after seeing the cook,
“scare up a drink of water for this gentleman.
I speak of you, sir, as your clothes
warrant me to speak. You are not a Texan.
You haven’t been long enough in this country
to become accustomed to their way of talking.
You are from the States.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; from Wisconsin,” said Bill,
rightly concluding that Mr. Davenport would
not be acquainted with anybody in that far
off State. “I was engaged in doing a good
business in Milwaukee, but I fell in with some
fellows who were going to the mines, and
there I lost what little money I had.”</p>

<p>“Did you go to California?”</p>

<p>“No; to Denver.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[253]</span></p>

<p>“Then how did you happen to get way off
here? This is not the road to the States.”</p>

<p>“I know it; but I wanted to find my partner,
who is in this country engaged in the
cattle business.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Faber, if that’s his name,
hasn’t got a ranch anywhere around here.
The men who live beyond me are Mr. Chisholm&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Davenport went off into a paroxysm
of coughing, to which Bill listened
with great concern pictured on his face.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you are talking too much,”
said he. “Doesn’t this climate agree with
your health?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I should probably have been in
my grave long ago if I had not come down
here. Now, sir, your meal is ready. Will
you step in and sit down to it?”</p>

<p>Bill thanked him, and went in to a much
finer spread than he had been accustomed to
while roaming with his men. He ate until he
was ashamed of himself, and came out on the
porch with the air of one who had enjoyed a
good meal. There was one thing about it he<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
told himself: No matter what misfortunes his
cattle might meet with, Mr. Davenport intended
that those who were dependent upon
him should fare the best.</p>

<p>“I have a little money left,” said he, “and
I want to know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Keep your money in your pocket,” returned
Mr. Davenport. “When I have
twenty-five thousand head of cattle to sell for
a dollar apiece I can easily afford to give you
something to eat. Sit down. You say you
were in the mines at Denver. What sort of
work are they having there?”</p>

<p>This was the very point that Coyote Bill
had been dreading, but he had gone over it so
many times since leaving Henderson in camp,
that he had it at his tongue’s end. He knew
no more about mining than he had been able
to glean from the conversation of his men,
some of whom were fresh from Mexico, and
perhaps he got the two pretty well mixed up.
For example, he told of one mine he had
been in where they had been obliged to go
down twelve hundred feet before they could
get gold in paying quantities. Then Mr.<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
Davenport began to look at him suspiciously.
There might be some men at some future time
that would be able to go down that distance,
but there were none there now.</p>

<p>“I believe you are up to something,” said
he to himself. “But what in the world it is
I don’t know. I believe I will keep you here
for a while and find out.” Then aloud he
said: “Where are you going now? If your
friend isn’t around here, where do you think
you will find him?”</p>

<p>“I guess I had better go back to Austin
and work around there at something until
I can earn money enough to take me home,”
said Bill, hoping that Mr. Davenport would
suggest something else to him. “Any little
thing that I can do will help me along.”</p>

<p>“How would you like to stay here and
work on this ranch?”</p>

<p>“That would be all very well, but I can’t
ride. I should have to do something about
the house or I shouldn’t earn my money.”</p>

<p>“You look like a man who could sit a
horse.”</p>

<p>“I know it; but they buck and jump so<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
that they throw me right off. When I was in
the mines I devoted myself entirely to work.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will tell you what I will do. I
can find some work for you around the ranch
that you can turn your hand to.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be much&mdash;like making the beds,
for instance. Besides, you look completely
exhausted. You can stay here until you
somewhat recover yourself and make some
enquiries among the cowboys, and perhaps
you will learn something about your partner.
I am determined to know what you are at,”
added Mr. Davenport to himself. “Can it
be that you are any ways implicated with
Clifford Henderson? Well, I have got my
will made out, and I will see what you will do
to it.”</p>

<p>Thus it came about that Coyote Bill became
an inmate of Mr. Davenport’s house. When
the cowboys came in at supper time he was as
respectful to them as he was to Mr. Davenport,
addressed them all as “sir,” when he
was speaking to them, and by giving them
a sharp look when they came in made up his<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
mind that there was no one among them who
recognized him. He looked them squarely in
the eye when he talked to them, and listened
while they told him of the men who lived
beyond them. There was no Mr. Faber in the
lot. He must be inside of them somewhere.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that fellow, Lem?”
asked Frank, as the two met under the trees
to smoke their evening pipe. They had left
Bill in the house and he was busy at work
with the dishes.</p>

<p>“He is here for no good, that’s what I think
of him,” said Lem, seating himself under the
nearest tree. “He has been out to Denver,
and came out here to find somebody he never
heard of. He never had a pardner named
Faber, and what do you think of his going
into a mine that extended twelve hundred feet
under the ground? I tell you he has never
been near Denver.”</p>

<p>“And he can’t ride!” added Frank. “I
see the marks on his boots where he has had
spurs on. I tell you he wants to be mighty
careful how he acts around here.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind them six-shooters he’s got?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[258]</span></p>

<p>“I do, and I aint afraid of them, nuther.
I guess I can get a pistol out as quick as he
can. Just keep your eye on him and we’ll
see what he is going to do.”</p>

<p>The days grew into weeks and the weeks
into months, and still Coyote Bill stayed
around the house. In fact he didn’t say
a word about going since he was settled there.
He seemed to think that the man he was in
search of was somebody he couldn’t reach,
and he was content to remain where he was.
Mr. Davenport kept his eye out at all times,
and the only thing he found against Bill was
when he caught him trying to pick his desk.
He came suddenly into the room where Bill
was at work, and the position he caught him
in was enough to condemn him. But Bill was
equal to it. He greeted him with a good-morning,
and proceeded to tumble up his bed
as though nothing was the matter.</p>

<p>“Why do you have this door shut?”
enquired Mr. Davenport, with more sternness
than he had ever thrown into his words. “I
generally leave it open.”</p>

<p>“I found it shut when I came in, sir,” said<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
Bill. “I always make it a point to leave
things as I find them. It’s a fine day outside,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course it is a fine day here in this
country,” said Mr. Davenport, who was wishing
every day that it would rain. “We never
see any clouds here.”</p>

<p>Things went on in this way until we came
there, and for once Mr. Davenport forgot himself
and took us into his confidence. I had
noticed ’Rastus Johnson, and I didn’t think
there was anything strange about it, except
that he seemed to sympathize with me,
because I had lost my cattle. But, then, that
was something that fell to everybody down
there, and besides I had more than made my
loss good. Finally, the time came when I
bearded the lion in his den, and, prompted by
Elam, called him by his right name. Of
course he was thunderstruck, but I think I
did the best thing I could under the circumstances.
He made up his mind to steal the
pocket-book at once, and boldly proposed the
thing to me as if I had agreed to “become
one of them.” I got out of it somehow, and<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
that was the night that he and Elam got into
that “scrap.” He went off, as I expected he
would, and I did not see him again until he
and Clifford Henderson came to the ranch to
hunt up the missing pocket-book. You saw
how he treated me while he was there. Tom
Mason’s luck came in; he found the pocket-book,
and I hadn’t seen Bill since. And now
Henderson was gone, and I concluded that
with all those men watching us we couldn’t
reach Austin without a fight. But we had
ten good men, and they were all good shots.
And I saw that others felt the same way.
Well, let it come. I was sure of one of them,
anyway.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">PROVING THE WILL.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">When Clifford Henderson turned his
nag and galloped away from us, he
was about the maddest man I ever saw
mounted on horseback. When I said away
from “us,” I mean from the three or four
men whom he had been trying to induce to
buy his cattle, and Tom Mason and myself.
He had good reason to be angry. He had
come out to the ranch while we were there;
and although he had things all his own way,
and one of the men who were with him had
searched us to prove that we didn’t have the
pocket-book, he had hardly got out of reach
of the house when Tom had it in his possession.
That was as neat a piece of strategy
as I ever heard of, this finding the pocket-book
after he had got through looking for it,
and I didn’t wonder that he felt sore over it.
He meditated about it as he rode along, and<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
the more he thought about it, the more nearly
overcome with rage was he.</p>

<p>“To think that that little snipe should have
gone and found the pocket-book after I had
got done looking for it&mdash;that’s what bangs
me!” he exclaimed, shaking his fists in the
air. “No wonder they call him Lucky Tom.
But there is just this much about it: the
pocket-book is not going to do him any good.
I’ll go and see Bill about it, and then I’ll go
to Austin, find the surrogate before he does,
and challenge the will. By that means I shall
put him to some trouble before he can handle
the stock as he has a mind to.”</p>

<p>Henderson evidently knew where he was
going, for he went at a tremendous rate until
nearly four o’clock in the afternoon, stopping
only twice at some little streams that he
crossed to allow his horse time to get a drink,
and then he rode into a belt of timber where
he found Coyote Bill waiting for him. He
had two men there with him as a body-guard.
Henderson got off his horse, removed his
saddle, and turned the animal loose before he
said a word. Bill was watching him all the<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
time, and concluded that he had some bad
news.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he impatiently, “as soon as
you get ready to speak let us hear from you.”</p>

<p>“I can easily think of myself as being
fooled in this way, but for a man like you,
who makes his living by cheating other folks,
I don’t see any excuse at all for it!” said Henderson,
as he threw himself on the ground
beside Bill. “We have lost the pocket-book!”</p>

<p>“Did those boys find it?” asked the man,
starting up in amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; they have found it! I have seen
the will.”</p>

<p>“Why, how in the name of common sense
did they find it?” said Bill, who could not
believe that his ears were not deceiving him.
“And you have seen the will?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have. Everything goes to that
boy, dog-gone the luck!”</p>

<p>“Tell us all about it. I don’t understand
it.”</p>

<p>“You know we saw them when we got to
the ranch, and they found the pocket-book.<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
That’s all I know about it. When they
returned they found me trying to sell the
cattle to some of the outfit, and they produced
the will. I saw it and read a portion of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are a pilgrim, and that’s a fact.
Why didn’t you destroy the will? I’ll bet
you that if they showed me the will they
would never see it again.”</p>

<p>“Suppose there was a revolver pointed
straight at your head. What would you do
then?”</p>

<p>“You were a dunce for letting them get
that way.”</p>

<p>“Suppose there were three men, and while
one of them had your head covered with a
pistol, another should ride up and lay hold of
your bridle? I don’t reckon you would help
yourself much.”</p>

<p>“Did they have you that way? Then I beg
your pardon,” said Bill, extending his hand.
“They didn’t give you much show, did they?
But you threatened them, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“No; I simply told them that I was next of
kin and wanted to see the will. I could tell
whether it was a fraud or not. I recognized<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
my brother’s handwriting at once, but I told
them it was a lie out of the whole cloth.”</p>

<p>“And does the will make the boy his heir?”</p>

<p>“It does. Now I want to go to Austin and
get there before Chisholm does. I can put
him to some trouble before he handles that
stock.”</p>

<p>“Is Chisholm going there?”</p>

<p>“He must, to get the will probated.”</p>

<p>“Then you just take my advice and keep
away from Austin. Chisholm would shoot
you down as soon as he would look at you.
You don’t know Chisholm. He’s a mighty
plain-spoken man when he’s let alone, but you
get his dander up and he’s just lightning. He
has got an idea that you are trying to cheat
Bob out of his money and that you are
a rascal. No, sir; you keep away from
Chisholm.”</p>

<p>“But what am I to do? Am I going to sit
still and allow myself to be cheated? That’s
the way folks do things in St. Louis.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but it isn’t the way they do here.
You needn’t allow yourself to be cheated out
of that money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[266]</span></p>

<p>“What do you propose to do?”</p>

<p>“Put the Indians on him.”</p>

<p>“The Indians?” exclaimed Henderson.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Bill coolly. “What do you
suppose I have got the Indians for if it isn’t
to help me out in a job of this kind? You
said you wanted him shut up until he signed
his property over to you, and I don’t think
you will find a better place.”</p>

<p>“Why, my goodness, they will kill him!”
said Henderson, horrified at the idea of making
Bob a prisoner in the hands of those
wild men.</p>

<p>“I’ll risk it. Just put him among the
Indians with the understanding that he is
to remain there until he signs his property
over to you, and he’ll soon sign, I bet you.”</p>

<p>Henderson was silent for a long time after
this. He didn’t see any other way out of it.
The idea of his going to Austin and being shot
by that man Chisholm was not exactly what
it was cracked up to be. He knew that Chisholm
would shoot if he got a fair chance, for
he had already seen him behind his revolver;
and he didn’t care to give him another such a<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
chance at him. Coyote Bill gave him time
to think the matter over and then said:</p>

<p>“Suppose the Indians do kill him; what
then? It will only be just one stumbling
block out of your way. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Are the Indians much given to making
raids on the stockmen hereabouts?” asked
Henderson.</p>

<p>“They do it just as often as they get out of
meat,” answered Bill. “The only thing that
has kept them from it has been the drought.
They know what these white men are up to.
All this country will be settled up some day,
and then what will they do to get something
to eat? It will be perfectly safe putting the
Indians on him.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on with it,” answered Henderson.
“Remember, I don’t go in for lifting a hand
against his life. I want him to know what it
is to be in poverty. That’s what I am up to.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you find any more poverty-stricken
people in the world than the Comanches
are, I will give it up,” said Coyote
Bill, with a laugh. “Let him stay among
them. I will agree to keep him safe for<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
twenty years. Now I will go and see what the
men think about it. What do you say to that,
Zeke? This is a squaw-man,” he added, turning
to Henderson. “The chief and all of them
do just as he says.”</p>

<p>“I say you can’t find a purtier place to put
a man than among the ’Manches,” said Zeke,
as he pulled a pipe out of his pocket and
filled up for a smoke. “If you want to
put him whar he’ll find poverty, put him
thar.”</p>

<p>“But I am afraid to trust the Indians with
him,” said Henderson. “They might kill
him.”</p>

<p>“Not if the chief says ‘No,’ they won’t.
This here is our chief,” he answered, waving
his hand toward Coyote Bill. “We aint
beholden to nobody when he says we shall
go on a raid, an’ I think it high time we were
doin’ something. It’s almost sixteen months
since we have seen any cattle, an’ we’re gettin’
hungry.”</p>

<p>“Does Sam think the same way?” said Bill.</p>

<p>The man appealed to nodded, and so it came
about that we did not see any of Coyote Bill’s<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
men while we were on our way to Austin. In
fact there were not enough of them. It would
have taken twice the number of our company
to have placed their hands on that pocket-book,
feeling as we did then.</p>

<p>I never was more shaken up than I was
when I rode into Austin, but I didn’t say
anything about it. Accustomed as I was to
travelling long distances on horseback, I must
say that, when we rode up to our hotel and
dismounted, I didn’t have strength enough to
go another mile. Chisholm was as lively as
ever. He got off his horse with alacrity,
looked around him and said:</p>

<p>“There! Two hundred miles in considerably
less than forty-eight hours. I guess Henderson
can’t beat that. Seen anything of
him around, have you?”</p>

<p>The men all answered in the negative.</p>

<p>“I wish you boys would take these horses
back to the stable,” said he, “and the rest
of you stay by when I call you. When you
come back go into the living room with the
rest of the boys. Lem, you and Frank seat
yourselves on the porch and keep a lookout<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
for Henderson. If you see him I needn’t
remind you that you are to pop him over.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Chisholm!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“It has to be done,” said Mr. Chisholm
earnestly. “We have stood as much nonsense
as we can. He has tried his level best
to steal our money from us, and now we have
got to a place where we can’t be driven any
further. I’ve got a little business of my own
to attend to. Mr. Wallace, who has a thousand
dollars or two of mine, is, I think, a
man I can trust.”</p>

<p>So saying Mr. Chisholm started off, and
we all departed on our errands&mdash;Frank and
Lem to the porch to keep a bright outlook
for Henderson, the most of the men to the
sitting room of the hotel to wait Mr. Chisholm’s
return, and us boys to take the horses
to the stable. I was surprised when I saw
how Bob took Mr. Chisholm’s order to heart&mdash;to
pop Henderson over. I declare I didn’t
feel so about it at all. If Henderson so far
neglected his personal safety as to continue
to pursue Mr. Chisholm when he was on the
very eve of getting the money, why, I said,<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
let him take the consequences. Bob didn’t
say anything, but I well knew what he was
thinking about. If he had had a fair opportunity
he would have whispered to Henderson
to keep away from the porch.</p>

<p>“You musn’t do it, Bob,” I said to him.</p>

<p>“Why, Carlos, I can’t bear that anybody
should get shot,” he answered. “And then
what will they do to Lem and Frank for
obeying that order of Mr. Chisholm’s?”</p>

<p>“They won’t do anything to them. Mr.
Chisholm is willing to take his chances.
Don’t you know that they never do anything
to anyone who shoots a man in this
country?”</p>

<p>When we had put the horses away we returned
to the porch, and found Lem and
Frank there keeping a lookout for Henderson;
but I would have felt a good deal more
at my ease if we had known of the interview
that Henderson had held with Coyote Bill
in regard to putting the Indians on Bob.
We took a look at them and then went into
the sitting-room to wait for Mr. Chisholm. He
was gone about half an hour and then he<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>
showed himself. He stopped to exchange a
few words with Lem and Frank, and then
coming into the sitting-room ordered us to
“catch up!” We knew by that that he was
ready for us, so we fell in two abreast and
followed Mr. Chisholm down the street.</p>

<p>I wondered what the people in the Eastern
cities would have thought of us if they had
seen us marching down the street, ten of us,
all with a brace of revolvers slung to our
waists. The pedestrians got out of our way,
and now and then some fellow, with a brace
of revolvers on, would stop and look at us
to see which way we were going. But we
did not care for anybody. We kept close
at Mr. Chisholm’s heels until he turned into
a narrow doorway, and led us up a creaking
pair of stairs. Upon arriving at the top he
threw open a door, and we found ourselves
in the presence of three or four men who
sat leaning back in their chairs with their
heels elevated higher than their heads, having
a good time all by themselves. There
were a lot of papers and books scattered
about, and I took it at once for a lawyer’s<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
office. They looked at us in surprise as we
entered, and one of the men took his feet
down from the desk.</p>

<p>“Shut the door, Lem,” said Mr. Chisholm.
“Now, which of you men is it who proves
the wills? You see,” he added, turning with
an air of apology to the other men in the
room, “these fellows are mostly remembered
in the will, and so I brought them along. I
never proved a will before, and so I wanted
men enough to back me up.”</p>

<p>“That is all right,” said the surrogate.
“Where’s the will?”</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm produced his pocket-book,
Bob’s pocket-book, rather, the one that had
taken Tom and me on a four weeks’ journey
into the country, and produced the papers,
while the rest of us stood around and waited
for him to read them. The lawyer read it
in a free-and-easy manner until he came to
the place where Bob was spoken of as worth
half a million dollars, and then he suddenly
became interested.</p>

<p>“Where’s the man?” said he.</p>

<p>“Here he is, right here,” said Mr. Chisholm.<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
“It is a big sum of money for him
to be worth, but he is big enough to carry it.”</p>

<p>“Why, sit down, gentlemen! If you can’t
get chairs enough to accommodate you, sit
on the table. A half a million dollars!
Does anybody challenge this will?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of,” answered Mr. Chisholm.
“It is all there, and we want it all,
every bit.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll have it for you in half an hour,”
answered the lawyer. “Suppose you come in
again in that time.”</p>

<p>“No, sir! Our time is worth nothing, and
if it is all the same to you, we’ll have that
will before we go out. When I get through
here I have got to go to the bank. Take your
time. We want it done up right.”</p>

<p>Whether there was something in Mr. Chisholm’s
manner&mdash;there certainly was nothing
in his words&mdash;that convinced the lawyer that
haste was desirable, I don’t know; but he got
up with alacrity, went to his books, and began
writing, while the rest of us disposed of ourselves
in various attitudes about the room.
The rest of the men went on with their conversation<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
where our entrance had interrupted
it,&mdash;it was something that afforded them a
great deal of merriment,&mdash;and now and then
the lawyer took part in it, leaving his work
and coming over to where the men were
sitting to make his remarks carry weight.
Mr. Chisholm watched this for a long time
and at last boiled over.</p>

<p>“See here, Mr. Lawyer,” said he, and I
knew by the way he spoke the words that his
patience was all exhausted; “I would thank
you to attend to our business first.”</p>

<p>The lawyer was evidently a man who was
not in the habit of being addressed in this
way. He took a good look at Mr. Chisholm,
at his revolvers, then ran his eye over the rest
of us, and choking down something that appeared
to be rising in his throat, he resumed
his writing. After that there was no trouble.
The men ceased their conversation, and the
lawyer went on with his writing to such good
purpose that in fifteen minutes the document
was done.</p>

<p>“Now, who is this boy’s guardian?” asked
the lawyer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[276]</span></p>

<p>“He hasn’t got any that I know of,” said
Mr. Chisholm.</p>

<p>“How old are you?” he added, turning to
Bob.</p>

<p>“Sixteen,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Then you must have a guardian,” said the
lawyer. “Hold on, now,” he continued, when
he saw Mr. Chisholm’s eye begin to flash and
his hand to reach toward his pistol. “This
guardian is a man who can exercise much or
little control over this property. He can say
you shall or you shall not spend your money
for such particular things; but all the while
the boy can go on and do as he pleases. It
does not amount to anything.”</p>

<p>“Is that paper all ready for his signature?”
asked Mr. Chisholm.</p>

<p>“It is all ready for the signature of his
guardian,” said the lawyer. “But I tell you
it won’t amount to anything so long as he has
no one on it to act as his guardian. Why
don’t you sign it, sir? You seem to be on
good terms with him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm did not know what to say,
and so he looked around at us for a solution.<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
But the men all shook their heads and looked
down at the floor. They didn’t want anyone
to act as Bob’s guardian, but would rather
that he should spend the money as he pleased.
Finally Bob came to the rescue.</p>

<p>“I will sign it with Mr. Chisholm, but with
no one else,” said he. “This lawyer knows
more than we do.”</p>

<p>“And won’t you never ask my consent
toward spending your money?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I never will.”</p>

<p>“Then I will sign it. Remember, Bob,
there aint to be any foolishness about this.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm took the pen from the
lawyer’s hand and signed his name in bold
characters, and although there was no occasion
for Bob’s signature in a legal point of
view, the lawyer was afraid to object to it, for
there were too many pistols in the party.</p>

<p>“There, now; it is all right, and you’re
master of that money,” said Mr. Chisholm,
drawing a long breath of relief. “Nobody
can get it away from us now. How much?”</p>

<p>“Ten dollars,” said the lawyer.</p>

<p>As Bob didn’t have any money, Henderson<span class="pagenum">[278]</span>
having taken all he had, Mr. Chisholm
counted out the ten dollars, after which he
held out his hand for the will. There was
where he made another mistake. The surrogate
kept that will upon file, and then there
was no chance of its being lost, and anyone,
years hence, if there happened to be any legal
points with regard to the disposition of this
property, could have the will to refer to. But
Mr. Chisholm didn’t know that.</p>

<p>“I will take that document if you have got
through with it,” said he.</p>

<p>“The will?” said the lawyer. “As soon
as you go away I shall lock it up. Then it
will be safe.”</p>

<p>“You will, eh?”</p>

<p>In an instant his revolver was out and
covering the lawyer’s head. The other men
sprang to their feet, but before they could
make a move they were held in check by four
revolvers held in the hands of our own party.</p>

<p>“I have just about submitted to all the
nonsense I can stand with regard to this will,”
said Mr. Chisholm, in stern tones. “You
made me sign it as a guardeen when I aint got<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
no business to, and now you want to go and
take the will away from us. Hand over that
document! One&mdash;two&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Probating the Will.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>“There it is, and you can take it,” said the
lawyer, turning white. “But I tell you it
won’t amount to anything as long as you have
it in your hands. There’s the notice of probate.
You can take that down to the bank
with you, and that is all you want.”</p>

<p>“He is right, Mr. Chisholm,” said Bob,
who seemed to keep all his wits about him.</p>

<p>“Has he a right to take the will away from
us?” demanded Mr. Chisholm, in a stentorian
voice.</p>

<p>“I have got wills here that were left by
parties long before you ever came to this
country,” said the lawyer, turning to his safe.</p>

<p>“Not by a long sight you haven’t,” said
Mr. Chisholm. “I want you to understand
that I have been in this country long before
you ever came out of a pettifogger’s office in
the North. You can’t take that will away,
and that’s all about it.”</p>

<p>“Here is Jerry Wolfe’s,” said the lawyer,
taking from his safe a big bundle of papers all<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
neatly endorsed as he had filed them away.
“You knew him, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;yes; and a right smart business
man he was. Did his guardeen leave his
papers here?”</p>

<p>“His executor did, and that amounts to the
same thing. And all those in there are
wills.”</p>

<p>“That may be law, but it isn’t justice,”
said Mr. Chisholm, putting up his revolver
and stepping back; whereupon the men in his
party, who held their pistols in their hands,
let down the hammers and returned them to
their cases. “Have you got done with us?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; we are all through.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you are right, I am sorry I pulled
my revolver on you; if you are wrong, I’m
sorry I didn’t use it. You see, I never had
any experience before in proving wills, and I
never want to have another, unless I can have
someone at my back who knows more than
I do.”</p>

<p>“I assure you, it is all right,” said the
lawyer; and, to show that he was in earnest,
he cordially shook hands with Mr. Chisholm.<span class="pagenum">[281]</span>
“You go down to the bank, and if Mr. Wallace
doesn’t say that it is all right, I’ll make
it so.”</p>

<p>I, for one, was glad to get out of reach of
that surrogate’s office. There was too much
pulling of revolvers to suit me. I fell in behind
Mr. Chisholm, who led the way toward
the bank.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">TOM GETS SOME MONEY.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">I have often quoted our leader as saying
that Mr. Wallace was a man whom he
could afford to trust, seeing that he had the
handling of a thousand dollars or two of his
money. In point of fact, he had more than
that. He had two hundred thousand dollars
of money in his hands that Mr. Chisholm’s
signature was good for&mdash;not banknotes, for
they were not as good then as they are now,
but specie; and when a man put specie in
the bank, he always wanted to get the same
when he signed a check. The bank was not a
great way off, and in a few minutes we were
standing in the presence of the cashier.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Wallace in?” asked Mr. Chisholm,
gazing over the heads of three or four men
who had come there to do business.</p>

<p>“Step right into his private office,” said the
cashier. “He is waiting for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[283]</span></p>

<p>The private office was a little room that
opened off the rear of the bank, and when we
filed in you couldn’t have gotten another man
in edgeways. Mr. Wallace was engaged with
some papers, but laid them all down when he
heard our big boots clattering on the floor.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Chisholm!” said he. “Well, you
found ’em, didn’t you? Are these men all
remembered in the will? Where’s the boy?
Sit down.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see much chance to sit down
here,” said Mr. Chisholm, looking around.
“But, if it suits you just as well, I won’t sit.
Most of these men are remembered in the
will, and some of ’em aint. I brought ’em
along with me so as to give me plenty of backing.
This thing of probating wills aint what
it’s cracked up to be.”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter?” asked Mr.
Wallace.</p>

<p>“We found that little surrogate like you
was telling me of, and he won’t let me have
the will. Said he would lock it up, and it
would be safe.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Supposing you should<span class="pagenum">[284]</span>
die to-morrow and the will should fall into
the hands of some dishonest person. Where
would you be? The will is there, and anybody
can get a copy of it; but nobody can
touch the will itself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ah! That’s the way the thing
stands,” said Mr. Chisholm, and I thought he
felt a little sheepish over the way he had
acted in the surrogate’s office. “Then I was
wrong and he was right. But then,” he
added, a bright idea striking him, “he made
me sign it as guardeen. I had no business to
do that.”</p>

<p>“How old is the boy? Sixteen? Well, of
course he had to have somebody, and he
thought you would do. Where is the boy?
I haven’t congratulated him yet.”</p>

<p>“Here he is, right here,” said Mr. Chisholm,
seizing Bob by the arm and pushing
him forward. “He is a pretty fellow to have
a guardeen, is he not? He knows more about
taking care of his money than I do.”</p>

<p>Bob blushed like a school-girl when he was
pushed out into view, but he returned the
pressure of Mr. Wallace’s hand, and promptly<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
accepted the seat that was given to him. The
president then went on to tell Bob that he had
nearly seven hundred thousand dollars’ worth
of bonds and stocks, and about forty thousand
dollars in specie; did he want some
of it?</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I should like about ten thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p>“All right. Mr. Chisholm, will you sign
for that?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I won’t,” said Mr. Chisholm,
frightened at the amount. “You said you
wouldn’t ask me how to spend your money.”</p>

<p>“Bob can’t get it without you sign it,” said
Mr. Wallace. “I will make out the check
and you’ll sign it, of course. You are not
going to kick, the first thing!”</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm looked around to see what
the rest of us thought about it, but none of us
had anything to say. Mr. Wallace wrote out
the check, and then motioned to Mr. Chisholm
to take his chair and sign it; and our
leader obeyed without a word of protest. Mr.
Wallace then went out of his private office,
and in a few moments returned with his arms<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
filled with bags containing bright new gold
pieces.</p>

<p>“I’ll count them out for you if you want
me to,” said he, “but then the whole sum is
right here and the bags are sealed. What do
you want of such an amount of money, any
way? You can’t spend it out there on the
ranch.”</p>

<p>“No, sir. But some of these men have
been remembered in father’s will, and I want
to pay them up.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Mr. Wallace. “Well, then,
what’s the reason you can’t pay them right
here? It will make a less load for you to
carry.”</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Wallace, I have got something
to say about that,” said Mr. Chisholm.
“Not one cent do you give the men so long
as we are in the reach of bug-juice. I want
them to go home with me as straight as when
they came away.”</p>

<p>“All right. What shall we do with this
money?”</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm immediately stepped forward,
and under his supervision the money was<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
equally distributed so that each had an equal
weight to carry, but I noticed that Lem and
Frank didn’t get any of it. They were the
ones who were much too fond of “bug-juice.”
They winked at me, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Wallace, I am done with probating
wills,” said Mr. Chisholm. “You
made me sign as guardeen for a boy that is as
well able to take care of his money as I am,
and put my name to checks for which I am
not at all responsible, and I don’t like your
way of doing business.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want some money yourself?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not a red cent. The drought is
over now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“This has been fearful weather, hasn’t it?”
asked Mr. Wallace, anxious to get Mr. Chisholm
off on his favorite topic.</p>

<p>“Fearful! You follow the dead cattle that
we left behind while on our trip to the West
Fork of Trinity, and you can go straight to
my house. We left a trifle of over three million
dollars on the plains, and that’s a heap of
money to come out of poor men’s pockets. I
wish you good-day, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[288]</span></p>

<p>We all touched our hats to Mr. Wallace
and went out of his private office, and I drew
a long breath of relief. There had been no
shooting done, and I was glad of it. I was
hurrying ahead to get to Mr. Chisholm’s side,
to ask him if that order in regard to “popping
him over”&mdash;that is to say, Henderson&mdash;was
still in force, when I saw Frank seize Bob by
the arm and pull him back. I stayed back
with him, for I wanted to see how the thing
was coming out. I fell in with Tom Mason
right ahead of Bob and Elam, and Lem and
Frank brought up the rear. This was the
way in which we marched down, and Mr.
Chisholm couldn’t raise any objections to it.
After we had got fairly under way, I heard
Frank say to Bob, in a scarcely audible
whisper:</p>

<p>“Say, you wouldn’t mind lending Lem and
me a twenty, would you?”</p>

<p>“I should be glad to, but the bag is sealed
up,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>“Sh! don’t let Mr. Chisholm know it. You
couldn’t get the seal off’n the bag, could you?
Lem and me is mighty thirsty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[289]</span></p>

<p>Bob put his hand into his pocket, and I
could hardly keep from laughing outright
when I saw the contortions his face went
through in order to get the seal off the bag.
He worked as a boy never worked before, and
at last I saw, by the expression on his countenance,
that he had got the bag open. We
were pretty near to the hotel when this happened.
I heard the chinking of the pieces as
Bob drew his hand out and placed two twenty
dollars in Frank’s extended palm.</p>

<p>“Boys, I will give you that to pay you for
sticking by me,” said he. “Now, be careful,
and don’t take too much.”</p>

<p>“You’re right; we’ll stick by you,” said
Frank. “If you ever get in a scrape like this
again, send us word. We’ll not take too
much. We are afraid of Mr. Chisholm.”</p>

<p>They had got the money, and the next
thing was to get the whiskey. Mr. Chisholm
thought he was smart, and, no doubt, he was
in some things; but he had to deal with men
who were as smart as he was. When we got
back to the hotel, Frank and Lem threw themselves
into the chairs they had occupied before,<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
to keep a lookout for Henderson; but Mr.
Chisholm spoke a word or two to them, and
they got up and went into the house.</p>

<p>“Now, landlord, catch up,” said Mr. Chisholm.
“Can you get us an early supper?
We want to be away from here in an hour.”</p>

<p>The landlord was all attention. He was in
and out of the bar a good many times, but
Lem and Frank never went near it. They had
a good deal of time to spend in looking at the
pictures; I saw a half a dozen men talking to
them, and finally they came back to where we
were, and sat down. I winked at Lem, and
he winked back at me, and so I knew he had
got it; but how in the world he <em>got</em> it was a
mystery to me. I did not see him put anything
into his pocket; but, after we had eaten
supper and were about an hour on our journey
homeward, I saw the effects of it very perceptibly.
It did not make Lem and Frank loud
and boisterous, as they generally were when
they were full, but “funny”&mdash;all except
when Mr. Chisholm came back and scowled at
them, and then they were as sober as judges.
The next day, however, they were all right;<span class="pagenum">[291]</span>
but when Bob saw Frank stoop down and fill
his hat four times at a stream he was passing,
and drink it empty each time, he said:</p>

<p>“I am sorry I gave you that money yesterday.
You had by far too much.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Frank. “But with stuff
like this, one can drink all he wants to, and it
won’t go to his head. But we had a good
fill-up on account of your success, and there
wasn’t any shooting done, as I was afraid
there was going to be.”</p>

<p>“Shooting! I should think not.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, I was afraid there was going
to be. When Mr. Chisholm was passing that
little stream yesterday, and reached down and
filled his hat, as you saw me doing, it was all
I could do to keep Lem from shooting that
hat away from his mouth.”</p>

<p>“Why, how far off was he?” enquired Bob,
who had never heard of such a thing as that.</p>

<p>“We were a hundred yards or so behind
him.”</p>

<p>“Why, the old villain! He might have
missed the hat, and struck Mr. Chisholm
through the face.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[292]</span></p>

<p>“That was just what I was afraid he was
going to do, although I have seen Lem, when
he was perfectly sober, put all his bullets into
the same hole at that distance. But he is not
a villain, by any means,” said Frank earnestly.
“It shows what a man will do when
he gets too much old rye in him.”</p>

<p>I tell you I believed it, and I swore off on
whiskey then and there. And I have kept my
pledge from that day to this.</p>

<p>Lem and Frank being all right and having
no Henderson to look out for, we were longer
going than we were coming, and it took us six
days to overtake our cattle, which were being
driven slowly toward their respective ranches.
We went a little out of our way to enable Bob
to visit his father’s grave, and stood around
with our hats in our hands while Bob’s eyes,
his face suffused with tears, gazed upon the
scene he never was to see again. I supposed,
of course, that Bob, having been admitted by
all hands to be the heir of that property,
would be allowed to rest in peace; but I did
not know Henderson and Coyote Bill. They
persecuted him from the word go, and it was<span class="pagenum">[293]</span>
to end only with his leaving the country. The
cattle were getting fat now, the full moon was
close at hand, and the Mexicans and Indians
were waking up. I heard the men talking
about it as we rode along, and only wished
I could be there to see some of it; but I tell
you one raid by the Comanches fairly took
that all out of me.</p>

<p>On the evening of the sixth day after leaving
Austin we came up with the cowboys, who
were camped in a belt of post-oaks, and long
before we got up to them we found that they
had discovered us. Everyone wanted to
know how Bob had prospered, and when Mr.
Chisholm told them he had been successful in
spite of the surrogate’s efforts to cheat him
out of it, you ought to have heard that belt
of post-oaks resound with their cheers. Now
that he had time to think it over, Mr. Chisholm
still regarded the efforts of the surrogate
to keep the will as a fraud, notwithstanding
what President Wallace had told him.</p>

<p>“Aint he just as likely to die as I am?” he
demanded. “And can’t that Henderson go
there and get that will? I tell you I think it<span class="pagenum">[294]</span>
would have been safer in my own hands than
his. But I am done probating wills now.
The next time anybody dies he can get somebody
else.”</p>

<p>At last we arrived at our ranch and found
everything there just as we had left it. The
cowboys gazed in surprise at the result of
Tom’s search, for you will remember that he
threw the things in the middle of the floor
and had not had time to replace them. Then
Tom showed them the stick he had used
in unearthing the pocket-book and the
very spot where he had dug it out. There
weren’t ashes there enough to conceal it from
anybody who had tried hard to find it. I
could see that Bob was very grateful to Tom
for what he had done, and consequently I was
prepared for what he had to say to me
afterward.</p>

<p>It was two weeks before we got our cattle
all rounded out and driven off by themselves
where we could take a look at them. There
were not more than five thousand head, all
the rest that Mr. Davenport had owned having
been left on the prairie as a prey to the<span class="pagenum">[295]</span>
wolves. He must have lost as many as ten
thousand head, which amounted to a considerable
sum. But I ought to say that, long
before this happened, Bob had brought all his
cowboys together and paid them the money
that had been left to them in his father’s will.
It made less weight for him to carry, and,
besides, he wanted it off his mind. I wish I
could put it on paper, the scene he had with
Mr. Chisholm, who positively refused to pay
the money. It raised a roar of laughter,
which made the old man so mad that it was
all he could do to keep from pulling his
pistol; but Bob got around him at last, and
finally he gave in.</p>

<p>“If it is as you say&mdash;that you want some
disinterested party to pay them so that they
won’t believe that they have been cheated&mdash;why,
I will do it,” said he, seizing the nearest
bag of gold and emptying it upon the table.
“But you promised that there should be no
foolishness about this. Now, boys, watch me,
and see that I don’t make any mistake.
Frank, you come first. I’ve got an all night’s
job before me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[296]</span></p>

<p>But in an hour they were all paid, and not
one of the men had a chance to tell Mr. Chisholm
that he had made a mistake. They
received it reverently, for their minds were
with the man whose liberality had made so
great a change in their fortunes. It was more
money than they had ever had before in their
lives.</p>

<p>Shortly after that&mdash;the very next day it
happened&mdash;Bob said to me in a whisper that
he wanted to see me when all the cowboys had
gone to the round-up, so I stayed behind.
Elam had charge of the cooking now, for I
had almost forgotten to say that the Mexican
had discharged himself when we drew near to
the waters of the west fork of Trinity. He
heard that there was going to be a fight, and
so took himself safe out of reach of it. But
then we didn’t care for Elam; he had been
Bob’s friend all the way through, and we were
not afraid to trust him.</p>

<p>“Say, Carlos, I hardly know how to speak
to you about this,” said Bob, looking down at
the floor. “You say Tom Mason’s friends
are rich?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[297]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I know what you have on your
mind, and I’ll tell you just what I think about
it,” said I. “You know Tom got into serious
trouble where he lived, and he has somehow
got it into his head that if he can go home
with five thousand dollars, that trouble will
never come up again. How much truth there
is in it I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“I know all about his troubles, but he
ought not to let them prey so heavily on his
mind. Now, how much has he got left?”</p>

<p>“I think if you give him three thousand
dollars he will be all right.”</p>

<p>“That is what I think, too,” said Elam.
“He don’t belong in this country.”</p>

<p>“I know he don’t. He wants to get up the
States, where quail and black squirrels are
handy, and have some more fights with ‘Our
Fellows.’ On the whole I think the scenes
he passed through with those robbers are
more exciting than the scenes he passed
through here. If he can get a letter from his
uncle, stating that those things have been
forgotten, he’ll go back.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shan’t stay in his way,” said Bob.<span class="pagenum">[298]</span>
“You think three thousand dollars are all
he needs? I’ll see him this morning. If he
wants more he can have it.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have found your pocket-book
if it hadn’t been for him,” said I. “He
reminded me of a dog on a blind scent. He
poked around till he found it.”</p>

<p>This was all that was necessary for Bob to
know, and during that day I saw him several
times during the round-up talking with Tom;
but Tom insisted that he didn’t want anything.
About the time that night came, however,
and the cowboys came in tired and hungry,
Bob tipped me a wink, and I followed
him behind one of the wagons out of sight.</p>

<p>“I took him right where he lived,” whispered
Bob. “I told him he could go back to
his uncle, who was all the time worrying
about him, with more money than he had
stolen, and he agreed to take time to think it
over.”</p>

<p>“He took it, didn’t he?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it was all he needed. I shall be
sorry to part with Tom, but then home is the
place for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[299]</span></p>

<p>So it was settled that Tom Mason was to
leave us as soon as he could get a letter to his
uncle. We had always treated Tom as one
of the family, but somehow we got into the
habit of treating him better than usual. But
time went on and we didn’t see anybody who
was going into Austin to take a letter for him.
Meanwhile, we had bidden good-by to Mr.
Chisholm and all his friends, and were fairly
settled down to our business again. But there
was one thing that was different from what it
was during Mr. Davenport’s lifetime. Lem
and Frank stayed about the ranch now
entirely. Bob hadn’t got over his experience
with Henderson and Coyote Bill; in fact, Mr.
Chisholm was the one who recommended him
to keep them always near him, and Bob
intended that, if they came to his house, he
would give them as good as they sent.</p>

<p>Things went on this way, we repeat, when
one day that Frank was busy with some story
of his cowboy’s life, we heard a terrible
clatter of horses’ hoofs approaching the
house. Frank and Lem were on hand in an
instant, and, with their revolvers in their<span class="pagenum">[300]</span>
hands, went out to see what was the matter,
but there was no sign of Henderson or Coyote
Bill in the men who drew up at the door.
Two of them were soldiers and the other a
civilian, and their appearance indicated that
they had been through something of a fight.
One of the soldiers’ heads was all bloody, in
spite of the handkerchief that had been
bound around it, and the horse of the civilian
seemed ready to drop from a wound in his
side.</p>

<p>“What’s up? Indians?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, and they’re most here,” returned the
civilian. “Can you give us a bite to eat and
change our horses for us?”</p>

<p>“Indians!” repeated Bob. “Come in and
sit down. You can have all the horses you
want. But Indians!” he added with a shudder.
“In all the eight years we have been in
this part of the country we have never known
them to come so far South before.”</p>

<p>“Well, you will hear them coming now if
you stay here,” said one of the soldiers.
“You had better catch up and go with us.”</p>

<p>“Why, how did you manage to get on to<span class="pagenum">[301]</span>
them, anyway?” I asked, for like the rest I
had been so overcome with astonishment that
I could not say anything. “You look as
though you have been in a hard fight.”</p>

<p>“You may safely say that, and the way
they went about it satisfies me that there were
some white men bossing the job,” said the
soldier. “You see there were twenty-five of
us detailed to act as guard to our paymaster,
who had a lot of money&mdash;I don’t know how
much&mdash;to pay off the men at Fort Worth.
We were going safely along through a pass,
within a day’s journey of the fort, when they
jumped on us. I tell you I never saw bullets
fly so thick before.”</p>

<p>“Did they kill almost all the guard at one
fire?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“They got about half of us, and where the
rest are now I don’t know. Some got through
to the fort probably, and the rest of us, being
cut off, had to save ourselves the best way we
could.”</p>

<p>“Lem, you and Frank bring up a horse for
each of us,” said Bob suddenly. His face was
pale, but I saw that he had his wits about<span class="pagenum">[302]</span>
him. “You may turn the rest loose, for we
have all got to go now. I wish those boys
who were out with the stock had warning.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go and tell them,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“No, you had better stay by me,” said
Bob. “If there are some white men bossing
this, I think you will have all you can do.
Suppose Coyote Bill is among them?”</p>

<p>“By George! I believe you’re right,” said
Lem.</p>

<p>He jumped off the porch, and in company
with Frank went out to the corral to catch the
horses that were to carry us safely out of
reach of the Comanches. Bob had found a
cloth and was tying up the soldier’s head;
Elam was skirmishing around the house trying
to find something to eat; the other soldier
was filling up on water, of which he had
long been deprived; and the balance were
busy gathering up their weapons. For myself,
I was thinking over a certain proposition that
had suddenly suggested itself to me. It was
a dangerous thing, I knew; but I didn’t see
who else was to do it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A RAID BY THE COMANCHES.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">The thing I was revolving in my own mind
was this: Should I go all by myself and
warn the boys who were herding cattle on the
plains, and so run the risk of being captured
or shot by the Comanches, or should I stay
with Bob and go with him to a place of safety?
For I knew that Lem and Frank would exert
themselves to take him safely out of reach of
danger, while I could not say that for myself.
I would be going right back the way the Indians
were coming, and to be captured&mdash;that
is what I was afraid of, for I had seen men
who were taken prisoners by the savages, and
I knew what was in store for me. But those
boys had stood by us when we were in danger
and were willing to do so again. While I was
thinking about it my horse was brought up.
He was a small sorrel, who had brought me in
safety through many perilous places, and he<span class="pagenum">[304]</span>
was lithe and vigorous yet. I did not see but
that, if I got out on the prairie with two or
three Indians after me, I could make a good run
yet, and perhaps be able to overtake my party
before they had got very far away. My mind
was made up. Those boys would not have deserted
me, and why should I desert them? I
put my saddle on him, slipped on my bridle,
and threw the lariat off his neck. Then I
buckled my revolvers about my waist, picked
up my rifle, and mounted.</p>

<p>“Good-by, boys,” said I.</p>

<p>“Why, where are you going?” demanded
Bob. “We’re all going off in a minute.”</p>

<p>“I am going out to warn the boys,” said I.
“I think I will overtake you after a while.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t go!” exclaimed Tom. “You
will be certain to be captured, and you know
better than we can tell you what they will do
to you.”</p>

<p>“I know it perfectly well. But I have no
kith or kin to worry their heads about me,
and I can go as well as anybody. I know
right where they are&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But you have got to go along the road<span class="pagenum">[305]</span>
that the Indians are coming,” said the civilian,
who was utterly astounded by my proposition.</p>

<p>“I know that too, but somebody must go, or
leave those fellows to be killed. Come and
shake hands with me, boys, and let me go.”</p>

<p>“You are a brave lad, and I hope you will
come out all right,” said Frank, as the boys
came up one after the other. Elam and Tom
didn’t have a word to say, but they were badly
cut up. Bob’s eyes were filled with tears, and
he clung to me with both hands.</p>

<p>“Carlos, I am sorry that you have come to
this decision,” said he. “Why can’t somebody
else go? You have been with me so
long that you are like a brother to me.”</p>

<p>“The best of brothers must part some time
or other,” said I. “If I fall nobody will be
the wiser for it, except you fellows right
around here. Good-by, everybody,” I cried,
and with a circular sweep of my arm to include
all hands, I wheeled my horse and started on
my lonely journey. “There are some fellows
who will be sorry if anything happens to me,”
I soliloquized. “During the time I have been<span class="pagenum">[306]</span>
with them I have never made anybody mad,
and that’s a heap to say for a man who has
been to Texas. Now the next thing for me is
to look out for myself.”</p>

<p>In spite of all this delay, occasioned by
asking and answering so many questions, not
more than five minutes elapsed before I was
on my way to warn the cowboys. One learns
to think rapidly when living on the frontier,
and while we talked we worked. In a few
minutes I was beyond reach of the grove, and
taking my horse well in hand rode forward
at about half pace, and in half an hour more
this grove was out of sight behind the swells
and the last glimpse of the ranch had disappeared.
I was alone on the prairie, and
a feeling of depression I had never before
experienced came over me. I kept my horse
at half pace because I didn’t know how soon
he would be called upon to exert himself to
the utmost, and I did not want to ride a
wearied nag in my struggle for life. The
horse knew that there was something going
on, for he kept his eyes and ears constantly
on the alert, and having more faith in him<span class="pagenum">[307]</span>
than I had in myself, I watched him closely.
I was certain that he would smell an Indian
long before I could see him.</p>

<p>At the end of another half hour I began
to wonder why I did not see some signs of
the cowboys, but there was nothing in sight.
Nothing, did I say? Away off to the left
loomed up a body which was lying in the
grass. I couldn’t tell whether it was a beef
or a horse, for it was about half a mile away.
My horse discovered it at the same time and
snorted loudly.</p>

<p>“There is something over there as sure as
you are a foot high,” said I to myself, looking
all around to see what sort of a place I was
going to get in. I didn’t like the appearance
of things where that body lay. On all
sides of it, except the one by which I entered,
was a ravine, and it was so deep
that I could just see the tops of the willows
growing up out of it&mdash;a splendid place
indeed for an ambuscade. I didn’t want
to go in there, and that was the long
and short of it. “I must go in there and
see what that is,” said I, after taking note of<span class="pagenum">[308]</span>
all these little things. “It may be something
that will tell me of the fate of the cowboys.”</p>

<p>If my horse had refused to go in there I
believe I should have ridden back to the
ranch and never thought that I was guilty of
cowardice; but he didn’t. When I called on
him to go ahead he went, but he did not seem
to be holding his course toward the dead beef
or horse I have spoken of, but turned a little
to the right as if he were seeking evidence
a little further on. Wondering what there
was that my horse had in his mind, I humored
him, and in a few minutes was horror-stricken
at the scene he brought me to.
There, flat on his back, stripped, scalped,
his head beaten in by a stone or some
other blunt instrument, and mutilated beyond
description, lay Sam Noble, one of
our cowboys. Where the other two were
I didn’t know, nor did I waste any time
looking for them. I shall never forget it
as long as I live. He had evidently been
killed before he was captured, which was a
lucky thing for Sam.</p>

<img src="images/i_p308.jpg" width="600" height="428" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Killed by the Indians.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>As soon as I could recover my breath I<span class="pagenum">[309]</span>
pulled my horse about and took the back
trail with long jumps, but before my horse
had made half a dozen leaps I saw that I
was captured. Three Indians came riding
out of the ravine on my left, and scarcely
had they been discovered, when three or
four more came from the ravine on my right.
What was I to do? I had heard that when
a white man was surrounded by Indians, if
he would raise his gun in the act of shooting,
every Indian would at once get behind his
horse. I don’t know why that came into my
mind, but I tried it then and there, and in
an instant two of the Indians were out of
sight. They had gone down on the other
side of their horses, so that I had nothing
but a leg and a small portion of the head to
shoot at. The third Indian, however, retained
his upright position, and, holding up
his bare hand to me, shouted:</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot! We’re friends.”</p>

<p>You can imagine what my feelings were
as I sat there and listened to those words.
They were my friends, and yet Sam Noble
had been killed that very morning in the<span class="pagenum">[310]</span>
effort to escape from them! While I held
my rifle in my hands and sat there debating
the question, the Indians came quite
close to me, too late to escape, and I yielded
to them like one in a dream. I was able
to tell now what savages looked like in
their war-paint; and although they were
hideous enough before, you can’t conceive
what a difference those streaks of red and
yellow paint made in their appearance.
They looked just awful. The white man
was the only one among them that was not
painted, and I felt more like surrendering
my weapons to him than I did to any of
his savage crew. But I didn’t get the
chance. The first one who held out his
hand for my rifle was an Indian, and I
readily gave it up to him. The other Indian
seized my horse by the bridle, and the white
man, after securing my revolvers and buckling
them around his own waist, open my
shirt and felt all around for the belt that
contained my money; but he couldn’t find it.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” said he, with something
that sounded like an oath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[311]</span></p>

<p>“Where is what?” I asked, for I had by
this time recovered my wits. I had no idea
what would happen to me afterward, but I
knew that so long as I behaved myself with
them I need not stand in fear of bodily harm.</p>

<p>“The belt,” replied the man. “You
didn’t bring it with you?”</p>

<p>“It is hidden at the ranch,” I replied.
“We thought that somebody might try to
take it away from us.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will have to go after it, and
you will have to show us where it is,” said
the man. “But first I must take you down
here to show you to somebody here who
is anxious to see you.”</p>

<p>“To show me to somebody?” I exclaimed,
lost in wonder, as the redskin who held my
horse turned me around. I wasn’t terrified
any longer. My fright had given place to
something that was stronger than fear, and
I was amazed at the words the man said.
“Somebody” wanted to see me, and I wondered
who that somebody could be. Could
it be Coyote Bill? If it was, I was on nettles.
He would propose to me to “become<span class="pagenum">[312]</span>
one of them,” and when I refused, what
would happen to me? I resolved to follow
that matter up a little.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; there’s a man that wants to see
you,” said he. “He has got a name around
here that you don’t want to know too much
about, too.”</p>

<p>“Know too much about him? Why, I
know about him already. Is it Coyote
Bill?”</p>

<p>The man seemed surprised that I spoke
his name so readily. He looked at me as
though he hardly knew what to say.</p>

<p>“How did you learn what his name
was?” he asked at length.</p>

<p>“One of my chums guessed it,” I replied.
“Anybody who knows anything about Coyote
Bill would know that he didn’t come on that
ranch for nothing.”</p>

<p>The man said no more, but I was satisfied
from the little he did say that I was
right in my conjectures. There was another
thing that was strange to me, and the longer
I thought of it the more bewildered I became.
This white man had been to school,<span class="pagenum">[313]</span>
had received the benefits of an education,
and how did it come that he was there
among the Indians? There was something
strange about him and Coyote Bill, and I
wanted to get at the bottom of it, but I
may add that I never did. I took a good
look at the man who rode by my side, and
I didn’t see anything more desperate about
him than I had seen about Coyote Bill.
Take his weapons and buckskin suit away
from him, and dress him up in fine clothing,
and he would have passed for a business man
anywhere.</p>

<p>There was another thing that worried me as
I rode along. I wondered if any such capture
had ever been made by hostile Indians
before. The savages paid no more attention
to me than if I was one of themselves, but
seemed to have given me up entirely to the
white man. As soon as we got through the
willows and came out on the prairie again, we
rode along in single file, the white man just
ahead and the others bringing up the rear, so
escape was simply impossible. I knew I must
see that “somebody” who was so anxious to<span class="pagenum">[314]</span>
see me, and I nerved myself for the test. I
had nothing to fear until I saw him.</p>

<p>“Can these Indians speak English?” I
asked, at length.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the white man. “You can say
what you please and they won’t tell on you.”</p>

<p>“Well, the question I should like to have
you answer is, How in the world you ever
came out here among them?” said I. “You
have been to school and don’t talk as these
Texans generally do.”</p>

<p>“No, I have been to school; that’s a fact,”
said the man, after hesitating a little.</p>

<p>“What sent you down here?”</p>

<p>“Look here, my friend,” said the man,
turning around in his saddle and looking at
me with his snapping gray eyes; “I didn’t
agree to take you into my confidence.”</p>

<p>He used the very same words to me that
Coyote Bill had used when I asked him the
same question; and he didn’t seem to be
angry about it, either.</p>

<p>“What made you think anything brought
me down here?” he asked. “What brought
you down here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[315]</span></p>

<p>“I came to buy cattle, but the drought had
got in ahead of me and I thought I would
wait until it was over. Hallo! What’s the
matter with you?”</p>

<p>“You came down here to buy cattle?”
exclaimed the man, looking at me with an
expression of great astonishment on his face.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I did; and there are two other
boys in my party. But what surprises you
so greatly?”</p>

<p>“Then your name isn’t Bob Davenport?”</p>

<p>I said it was not, but I didn’t tell him what
my name was. I knew Bob very well, and
had left him at the ranch that morning. I
didn’t say, however, that he was making hurried
preparations for flight, for I thought that
was something the man could find out for
himself. The man listened in amazement,
and, when I got through, uttered a string of
oaths.</p>

<p>“Set me down for a blockhead, and you’ll
hit it,” he said, as soon as he could speak.
“I might have known that you were not the
fellow.”</p>

<p>“Did you calculate to capture Bob?” I<span class="pagenum">[316]</span>
enquired, and my astonishment and delight
were so strong that it was all I could do to
repress them. That is what I meant when I
said that Henderson and Coyote Bill began
persecuting Bob at once on account of his
wealth, and did not intend to let up on him
until he had been driven from the country. I
saw through the whole scheme at once. They
intended to keep Bob a prisoner among the
Indians until he was ready to do just as they
wanted him to do, and that would be to sign
his property over to Henderson. It didn’t
look to me as though that plan would work,
but Henderson evidently knew some way to
get around it.</p>

<p>“Why, of course I intended to capture Bob
Davenport,” said the man, and it was plain
enough to see that what I had said made him
very angry. “What use are you to me? If
I had known that you were not Bob I
wouldn’t have taken you prisoner.”</p>

<p>“What would you have done to me?”</p>

<p>“You saw that man up there that was shot
from his horse, didn’t you?” said he, in a
very significant tone of voice. “Well, you<span class="pagenum">[317]</span>
would have been that way now. I could
make mince-meat of you in two minutes!” he
added fiercely. “There’s timber right ahead,
and the redskins are just aching to get their
hands on you. But then you are a brave
boy; I will say that much for you. It isn’t
everyone who would go on and talk so when
he found himself a prisoner among hostile
Indians. I’ll wait until I see what Coyote
Bill will have to say about you.”</p>

<p>I tell you I was afraid of this, and my only
hope of salvation lay with Coyote Bill. I
rode along in silence after that and never had
anything more to say. I knew what the man
meant when he referred to the timber right
ahead. All that was needed for him was to
tell the Indians that his protection for me
was withdrawn, and in two minutes I would
have been stripped and staked out, and a
fire burning at one of my feet. All that
stood in his way of saying that was Coyote
Bill.</p>

<p>“I do know something that I want to tell
Bill,” I said.</p>

<p>“Very well, then keep it for him,” answered<span class="pagenum">[318]</span>
the man. “I don’t want to talk to
you any more.”</p>

<p>All that day and until far into the night I
rode along without seeing a living soul, never
once stopping to give our horses a bite to eat,
and then I suddenly became aware that we
were in the camp of Indians. While we were
going along a redskin sprang up on our right
and addressed a few words to us in his native
tongue, and then sank out of sight again. He
was one of the sentries who were out to watch
the cattle and see that they didn’t stampede.
We kept on and in a few minutes reached
the timber. There was no one in sight, and
no preparations made for supper, and I felt
about half-starved.</p>

<p>“You can take off your saddle and bridle
and camp here under this tree,” said the man.
“Let your horse go where he is a mind to.”</p>

<p>So saying he rode off, accompanied by all
the Indians save two, whom he left to act as
my guards. As I felt tired and discouraged,
too, it did not take me long to comply with
the white man’s orders, and when I removed
the saddle from the horse I judged by the<span class="pagenum">[319]</span>
way he shook himself and went to cropping
the grass beneath his feet, that he was as
hungry as I was. While I was thus engaged
the Indians bustled about, and when I had
thrown myself on the ground, with my saddle
for a pillow, I found that they had a little fire
kindled; a very little fire, over which a white
man would freeze to death, but they sat
around it and warmed their hands with evident
satisfaction. But not a word was said
about supper, and I began to think I should
have to go hungry to bed, when I heard the
twigs cracking out in the timber, and in a few
minutes up came the white man, accompanied
by Henderson and Coyote Bill. I wasn’t so
surprised to see Henderson there as a good
many people might think. He was with
Coyote Bill, and of course he was bound to
take up with Bill’s companionship.</p>

<p>“Well, well, Carlos; how are you?” said
Bill; and to show that he was in a humorous
mood, he backed toward a little mound of
earth, sat down upon it, and laughed
uproariously.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” said I, taking a few<span class="pagenum">[320]</span>
steps toward Bill and extending my hand; for
I thought, if I could lead the man to shake
hands with me, I would be all right.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want to shake hands with
you,” said he. “The Indians are on the
watch, and they take that as a sign of friendship.
But what in the world induced you
to come out? Why didn’t you stay at the
ranch? You have got yourself in a pretty
fix!”</p>

<p>“I say give him a dose of lead,” muttered
Henderson, who was almost overcome with
rage. “I’ll have him out of my way, at any
rate.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough out of you,” said Coyote
Bill. “Such things are only done here when
I say the word.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t that boy been in my way ever since
I have been here?” exclaimed Henderson.
“Didn’t he go out to the ranch and find that
pocket-book?”</p>

<p>I was astonished to hear Henderson talk
that way. He had been growing worse instead
of better; but, after all, when I came to consider
the matter, I didn’t see that there was<span class="pagenum">[321]</span>
anything so very surprising about it. Some
writer has said that if we don’t grow better we
grow worse, and that was what was the matter
with Henderson. One of the first things he
spoke of in regard to Bob was, that no finger
should be lifted against his life; and here he
was going to shoot me who hadn’t done anything
to him.</p>

<p>“He got the pocket-book because we were
not fortunate enough to look where it was,”
said Coyote Bill. “Now, Henderson, I don’t
want to hear another word out of you. You
are under my protection now, but the minute
I withdraw it&mdash;well, you know what will
happen.”</p>

<p>“You asked what should be done with that
boy,” said Henderson. “Well, I have told
you.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t think you would propose any
fool thing like that,” said Bill. “I must first
take Carlos back to the house with me. You
know where all that money is kept hidden,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I know where it is,” I answered,
considerably surprised. To think<span class="pagenum">[322]</span>
that any man in his sober senses would go off
and leave his money behind him, was ridiculous.
I looked at Coyote Bill to see if he
meant what he said, but it was so dark that
I couldn’t see the expression of his face; but
Henderson evidently knew what he was speaking
about when he said, in a voice choked
with passion:</p>

<p>“You are going to lay a plan for him to
escape. I wish I could talk to these Indians,
for then I could let them see what you are
up to!”</p>

<p>“What I choose to do is nothing to you!”
said Bill, as he turned fiercely upon Henderson.
“Once more, and for the last time, I ask
you to keep still. How did you find out that
we were coming, any way?” he added, addressing
himself to me.</p>

<p>“There were three men came along who
had plainly been in some sort of a fight,” said
I. “We wanted to know what the trouble
was, and they told us.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes! Did they tell you about the
mule that got away from us?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what mule you mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[323]</span></p>

<p>“We got all the money except five thousand
dollars, and that was supposed to be
packed on a mule that lit out. He was shot
three or four times, but I never saw anything
run as he did.”</p>

<p>“And did he escape?”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say so. He took right
down toward your ranch, too, and I didn’t
know but you had seen him there.”</p>

<p>“And yet, in the face of all this&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Henderson didn’t say any more, for Coyote
Bill turned around and looked at him. He
thought his companion was in earnest when
he told him to keep still.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know but that it would be a
good chance for lucky Tom to try his hand
on that mule,” said Coyote Bill, with a smile.
“He has been lucky in finding one pocket-book,
and he might be equally lucky in
this.”</p>

<p>“He will go down among those rich cattlemen
and be captured,” said Henderson bitterly.
“The men who don’t care a cent for
those five thousand dollars will have just that
much more to jingle in their pockets; while<span class="pagenum">[324]</span>
we, who are hard up for the money&mdash;dog-gone
the luck! it is so the world over.”</p>

<p>Coyote Bill laughed again.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything so very laughable
about this matter,” said Henderson. “You
laughed because we got the wrong boy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That will do,” said Bill. “You are getting
off on your old subject, and I won’t sit
here and be abused. Haven’t had any supper
yet, have you, Carlos?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t; and I feel as though I
could do justice to some corn bread and
bacon.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, come with me.”</p>

<p>Turning to the Indians, he addressed some
words to them in their native tongue,&mdash;it
sounded like gibberish to me,&mdash;and started at
once into the woods, while I picked up my
saddle and bridle and followed behind him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">MY FRIEND THE OUTLAW.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">“Well, this bangs me completely,”
thought I, as I shouldered my
bundle and stumbled along behind my leader
through the darkness. “But I would like to
know if any white man has ever been captured
before by hostile Indians and treated in this
way. Coyote Bill seems to have the power in
his own hands, doesn’t he? I tell you, he <em>is</em>
a power in this land, and if he will let me get
away from him this time, he’ll never see me
again. I’ll go for the States the very first
chance I get.”</p>

<p>Bill seemed to know just how fast I could
go to keep up with him, and in a few minutes
I saw a light shining through between the
trees, and presently I was ushered into his
camp. There were three or four men lying
around the fire, and they started up and
looked at us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[326]</span></p>

<p>“We have caught the wrong boy,” said
Bill, waving his hand to show that I could put
my saddle and bridle down where I pleased;
“but he has got to show us the place where
that money is hidden before he gets away.
He hasn’t had anything to eat, and is
hungry.”</p>

<p>I sat down and looked at the men, and, I
tell you, some of them were pretty rough
characters. I was glad indeed that I had
fallen into the power of Bill’s best looking
man, for if I had been captured by any one of
the men sitting there at the fire, I should
have fared badly. They expressed a sentiment
of strong disgust when Bill spoke of
having captured the wrong boy, but no attention
was paid to it. He proceeded to fill a
long pipe very carefully, after which he went
off into the darkness, while another man set
before me some bacon and corn bread. It was
not enough to satisfy my appetite, but I was
glad to get what there was, and in a short
time it had all disappeared. Then I filled my
pipe and settled back for a smoke.</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose Bill is gone?” I<span class="pagenum">[327]</span>
asked, addressing my enquiries to whoever
had a mind to answer it.</p>

<p>Henderson was there, and in forming this
question I looked particularly hard at him,
not because I wished him to reply to it, but
because I wished to see how he took matters.
He was as mad as he was in camp when Mr.
Chisholm found that he had got hold of the
pocket-book containing the receipts, and not
hold of the one that contained the will.</p>

<p>“He has gone off to get permission of the
chief to burn you at sunrise,” said he spitefully.</p>

<p>“Sho!” said I, for I knew that Henderson
had made this all up out of his own head.
“Then he won’t get the money.”</p>

<p>“That’s the only thing that makes me think
he won’t do it,” said Henderson. “But you
will be gone up the next time you come here.
How did you know that we were after the
money, anyway?”</p>

<p>I repeated what I had said to Bill, and that
was nothing but the truth.</p>

<p>“There were three white men in the party,
and they said, from the way you went about<span class="pagenum">[328]</span>
it, they were satisfied that there were some
renegades bossing the job,” answered I; and
then I was almost sorry I said it. I did not
know how they would take the name “renegades,”
as applied to themselves; but Henderson
was the only one who understood it.</p>

<p>“And what made us renegades?” he asked,
and I believed that the presence of the men
was all that kept him from doing something
desperate. “We killed almost all the guards
at the first fire&mdash;I got two of them, I know,
and I wish we had got them all. Renegades!
That is a vile and worthless fellow,” he added,
turning to the men who were sitting around.
“That’s the kind of men you be.”</p>

<p>Some of the men laughed, while others
acted as though they didn’t care what men’s
opinions were of them so long as they were
permitted to enjoy themselves. I saw that
Henderson was trying to work the men up to
do something to me before Coyote Bill could
get back, and I didn’t think any more of him
for it.</p>

<p>“Thar is one thing about that attack that
I shall always be sorry for,” said one of the<span class="pagenum">[329]</span>
fierce-looking men. “You know I, for one,
had occasion to look out for the muels that
had the specie onto them. Tony here got the
man, an’ I shot the muel through the neck.
I could swear to that. Well, that thar muel
turned an’ run like he never run before, an’
got away with the Injuns completely. He
took right down by your ranch too. Didn’t
see nothing of him, I reckon, did you?”</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>“Well, thar’s a kind of a lucky feller down
your way, I don’t know what his name is,
who has a mighty fine chance of findin’
pocket-books when everybody else is done
lookin’ for them, an’ I didn’t know but what
he might try his hand at findin’ that muel
with five thousand dollars in specie strapped
onto him. That would be a pretty good haul
for him, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it would,” I replied. “But he
would have to give it up to the paymaster.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he would, would he?” exclaimed the
fierce-looking man. “If he found it, it would
be his’n, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“You needn’t look for those boys to do<span class="pagenum">[330]</span>
anything like that,” said Henderson, with a
sneer. “They would give it up to the paymaster
and get five hundred dollars for it. It
is a big thing to be honest!”</p>

<p>“Well, I think we’ve made as much as you
have by being honest,” said I. “You don’t
seem to be loaded down with money.”</p>

<p>“But I would have had half a million if it
hadn’t been for you and others like you,”
muttered Henderson between his clenched
teeth.</p>

<p>“You had all the chance in the world,” I
replied. “No one came near you when you
were searching that house. You see luck
wasn’t on your side.”</p>

<p>“What did you come here for anyhow?”
asked one of the men. “Folks say that you
came here to buy cattle, but I’ll be switched
if I don’t believe you came here to help
Davenport. You aint got no money to buy
cattle.”</p>

<p>This started us off on a new topic of conversation,
but Henderson seemed to find fault
with everything I said. I couldn’t reply to a
single question but it would start some spiteful<span class="pagenum">[331]</span>
remark on his part. I really did not see
how the men stood it. Finally Coyote Bill
came back, and I noticed that his pipe was
empty. He had smoked it out with the chief
in gaining his point, and I wanted to hear him
say that he had obtained permission to torture
me at sunrise; but he said nothing of the
kind, so that was one lie of Henderson’s
nailed.</p>

<p>“Carlos, you had better go to sleep,” were
the first words he spoke. “We have got a
long ride before us in the morning, and you
won’t feel a bit like getting up.”</p>

<p>“You want to watch him close for fear that
he will escape,” chimed in Henderson, who
could not possibly let a chance go without
saying something.</p>

<p>“He won’t escape. He won’t try to; will
you, Carlos?” continued Bill, turning to me.</p>

<p>“Not much,” I said. “Where shall I lie
down so that I will not be in the way?”</p>

<p>Bill selected a place, and picking up my
saddle and bridle&mdash;I do not know what made
me hang on to them, for I did not suppose I
would be allowed to ride my own horse in the<span class="pagenum">[332]</span>
morning&mdash;and with a cheery “Good-night,
fellows; pleasant dreams,” I laid down on
it. The majority of the men never paid any
attention to my salutation. Bill was the only
one who noticed it, and he said: “Thank
you; the same to you,” and that made me
think more than ever that he had been well
brought up.</p>

<p>“That’s a brave fellow,” I heard him say as
I arranged my saddle for a pillow and laid
down with my back to the fire. “It would
be a great pity if anything should happen
to him.”</p>

<p>“And you are going to give him a chance to
escape in the morning,” growled Henderson.
“I wish to goodness&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go to bed,” said Coyote Bill, in his ordinary
tone of voice.</p>

<p>“I wish to goodness that you, or any fellow
like you,” began Henderson, “had sense
enough to see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go to bed!” said Bill, and in an instant
his revolver was out and was looking Henderson
squarely in the eyes. This was the third
time that Henderson had been placed in a<span class="pagenum">[333]</span>
similar situation, but on this occasion he
didn’t say anything back. He knew that Bill
was in just the right mood to shoot. He gathered
up his saddle and blanket,&mdash;I didn’t have
any blanket to cover myself with, and the
nights were getting cold,&mdash;and that was the
last I saw of him that night.</p>

<p>“I made it,” said Bill, as soon as Henderson
was out of hearing. “I smoked a pipe
with the chief, and he came over to my way
of thinking. Jack, you will ride down to the
house with us in the morning.”</p>

<p>“But look here, Bill,” said the man who
had done most of the talking with me.
“Don’t you think those boys would be some
kin to the biggest kind of dunces if they went
off to escape from the hostiles, an’ left their
plunder buried where you could find it?
That’s what’s been running in my head ever
since you went out to see the chief.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so,” replied Bill.
“They went off in a hurry, did they not, and
forgot to take some of their things with them.
We have made thirty thousand dollars this
trip, and that is something worth having.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[334]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, an’ that dog-gone muel got away
from us. I expect that lucky feller at the
ranch will have him.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t help that. And if I don’t
find the money this time, I have got something
else in store for Bob. I’ll pounce on
him every chance, and steal his cattle by
piece-meal, until he is driven from the
country. And I wish to goodness that he
had never come into it.”</p>

<p>“Here, too! I don’t believe there was any
half a million dollars wrapped up in his
hide.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! there was. But we can’t touch
it now. Those men have been to Austin and
got the will probated&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“They have been to Austin and got it
proved, and the property is all in Bob’s name.
What we would have done if we had captured
Bob in the place of this Carlos, I don’t know.
Henderson thinks he could have got Bob to
sign the money over to him, but what good
would it have done? They’d say right away
that we had gained the signature by fraud, and<span class="pagenum">[335]</span>
then we would have a war on our hands, I bet
you. As it is, we can keep on stealing cattle;
we will have a few Rangers to whip, and that’s
all it will amount to. I am going to bed.”</p>

<p>I do not know that I was in any condition
to produce sleep, surrounded as I was by men
who had talked with satisfaction of seeing me
tortured at sunrise; but it is a fact that, as
soon as Coyote Bill sought his blankets, I sank
into an untroubled slumber, from which I was
awakened by Bill’s shaking me and ordering
me to catch up. I started up, only to find
that somebody had thrown a blanket over me
while I was asleep, and to see that the camp
of Indians was gone, and that there was no
one in sight except Coyote Bill, his man
Gentleman Jack,&mdash;I did not know what else to
call him,&mdash;and Henderson.</p>

<p>“They have all gone away with the cattle,”
said Bill, noting my feelings of surprise.
“You wouldn’t have us stay around here
with eight hundred head of stock to be captured,
would you? They have gone off to the
Staked Plains.”</p>

<p>I noticed while Coyote Bill was talking that<span class="pagenum">[336]</span>
the guns were scattered all around, and you
will, no doubt, wonder that I did not catch
one of them up and turn the tables on them.
There was a price of five thousand dollars set
upon the head of Coyote Bill, and it would
have been a fine thing for me to march them
all in as prisoners, but I knew a story worth
two of that. One was, I didn’t know how
many pistols Bill had about his person;
another was, there might be some men in
camp a short distance away who would upend
me before I fairly got the gun pointed;
and furthermore, I was firmly convinced that
if I did just as I was told to do, my release
would come in good time, and without the
necessity of shedding anybody’s blood. I tell
you it stands a fellow well in hand to take all
these points into consideration.</p>

<p>Breakfast over&mdash;and we ate it in a hurry,
everyone being obliged to cook his bacon on a
forked stick over the coals&mdash;there was nothing
left for us to do but get under way. According
to Bill’s order, I picked up my saddle
and followed him through the woods to the
prairie, and there I found my horse tied up to<span class="pagenum">[337]</span>
a brush. I was glad to see him again, and
when I got on him he was all ready for a race.
During the whole of that day we travelled without
scarcely exchanging a word, but I noticed
that at the top of every swell the outlaws
stopped and carefully examined the ground
before them. But no one was in sight, and
finally, just as the sun was setting, we came
within sight of Bob’s ranch. There was no
one about it, not even a steer or a horse. I
saw that Bill carried my weapons about with
him, and I thought that now was his time to
hand them to me, but Bill had different ideas
in his own mind.</p>

<p>“Appearances are often deceptive,” said
he. “Carlos, suppose you ride on and see if
there is anybody about that house. If you
don’t find anybody, wave your hat to us.”</p>

<p>“Anybody can see that he has a fine chance
for escape,” snarled Henderson, who was as
mad now as he had been the night before.
“I wish I had your power!”</p>

<p>“What would you do with it?” asked
Coyote Bill.</p>

<p>“I would let him feel one of the bullets in<span class="pagenum">[338]</span>
my pistol,” said Henderson. “You won’t
get anything out of that ranch as long as
you let him escape. He heard every word
you said last night.”</p>

<p>“Did you, Carlos?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I did,” said I. I thought I
might as well tell the truth as tell a lie.
My heart was in my mouth, but I looked Bill
squarely in the eye.</p>

<p>“Well, I want to know if you are going to
tell it?”</p>

<p>“If you tell me not to, I shan’t. I won’t
say anything about it while you are around.
I shall go for the States as soon as I can get
there, and Tom will go with me.”</p>

<p>“That will suit me exactly. I am satisfied.
Now, go on and see if you can find anything
around that ranch.”</p>

<p>Coyote Bill touched his hat&mdash;I have thought
more than once from the way he saluted that
he had been in the army&mdash;and I rode off.
Some things, which I had gone over so many
times that I had them by heart, promptly
came back to me. I wondered if any man
who was captured by hostile Indians was ever<span class="pagenum">[339]</span>
treated that way before. What Coyote Bill
saw about me; whether he thought there was
something that reminded him of other and
happier days, I don’t know. Anyhow, he
had saved me from a horrible death, and for
that I was grateful. I don’t believe there was
another man in the world that could have
done it. My horse neighed shrilly as he approached
the house, but there was no one who
came out to answer him. I kept on till I got
to the porch, and there I found the door open
and everything in the greatest confusion. The
ranch looked almost as bad as it did when
Tom Mason got through searching for the lost
pocket-book, only the things were not all
piled in the same place. I got off from my
horse and went in. Bob Davenport’s pillow
was on the floor, but the heavy bag of gold
which he had left after paying off his men
was gone. I looked in the place where my
money was hidden and found that it was
gone, too. Bob hadn’t left in such a hurry
that he had forgotten to take his valuables
with him. I knew that Coyote Bill was depending
on something he never could find, but<span class="pagenum">[340]</span>
then I freely forgave him. It was a plan of
his to aid me in my escape. When I had
fully satisfied myself that the money had
been taken, I went out on the porch and
waved my hat to Bill, and then I went into the
grove to look where Sam Noble had concealed
his, but that also had been taken away. Poor
Sam! He would never miss his money now.
And I wondered what had become of the
other two cowboys. I didn’t like to enquire
about it.</p>

<p>“It is gone, is it?” exclaimed Bill, who at
that moment came galloping up. “Well, we
have had our trouble for our pains. How do
things look in the house?”</p>

<p>“You can go in and see, but everything
that will be of use to you has been removed,”
said I. “Are you going to burn the house?”</p>

<p>“Burn it? What should I want to burn it
for? I want Bob to come back here and
live.”</p>

<p>“And you are mighty foolish for telling me
of it,” said I to myself. “I will never let him
stay in this house again. That’s one thing
that I didn’t promise to keep to myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[341]</span></p>

<p>Coyote Bill tossed his reins to his man and
went in, but he did not spend much time in
looking around. It was plain to him that no
money could be concealed there, and finally
he came out, took my rifle off his back and
handed it to me.</p>

<p>“There you are,” said he, “and I want you
to understand that the gun hasn’t been fired
since you gave it up. There’s your revolvers.
Now buckle them around your waist, so that
I can see how you look.”</p>

<p>I wondered what Bill was thinking of when
he did this, but I took the belt and put it
around my waist where it belonged, and
looked up for the man to tell what else he had
on his mind.</p>

<p>“Now, Henderson, you’re even,” said Bill.
“You said, if you had the power, you’d make
him taste one of the bullets in your pistol.
Now go ahead.”</p>

<p>I turned toward Henderson, and saw that
his right hand was fumbling with the pistol in
his holster. A minute more and he would
have me covered with it. I looked toward Bill
to see what he thought about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[342]</span></p>

<p>“You’re even,” said he, stepping back
a pace or two. “You have got more weapons
than he has.”</p>

<p>I saw the point Coyote Bill was trying to
get at, and in a second I had Henderson’s head
covered with one of my revolvers.</p>

<p>“Hands up!” said I hotly; and his hands
came up.</p>

<p>“Bill, I didn’t think that of you,” said
Henderson, who was fairly beside himself with
rage.</p>

<p>“You told me that all you wanted was to
get the power in your hands,” said Bill.
“Now you have it, and I don’t see why you
don’t use it. Be quick!”</p>

<p>I kept my eyes fastened upon Henderson,
and, fearing that Bill’s taunts might lead him
to do something wrong, for which he would
always be sorry,&mdash;for there was a good deal of
derision in what Bill said, and it showed what
a high estimation he had of Henderson’s
courage,&mdash;I held my revolver in readiness for
a shot, and stepped forward and took his gun
from its holster and handed it to Bill. The
latter took it with an expression of great disgust<span class="pagenum">[343]</span>
on his face, looked at it a moment, and
sent it as far out on the prairie as his sinewy
arm could throw it.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what your object is in shooting
me, who haven’t done you any harm,” I said,
addressing myself to Henderson, “but I tell
you not to attempt anything with that rifle.
If you do, I will tumble you off your saddle!”</p>

<p>“Henderson will not attempt to shoot us
with that,” said Bill. “If he does he will
have three of us to contend with, and I think
that is rather more than he can manage.
Now, Henderson, go for Austin as soon as
you can get there.”</p>

<p>“And give up my share of those thirty
thousand dollars?” exclaimed Henderson, his
astonishment getting the better of his alarm.
“Now, Bill, that isn’t right!”</p>

<p>Almost before Henderson had got through
with these words of protest, Bill’s hand laid
hold of his revolver, while with the other he
pointed out the direction he was to follow. I
noticed that Jack’s revolver came out also&mdash;he
had been sitting in his saddle all this time&mdash;and
rested across the horn, directly in range<span class="pagenum">[344]</span>
with Henderson’s person. He saw that
everything was up with him, and without
saying a word turned his horse and rode
away; and I may add that was the last I
ever saw of Henderson. We went to Austin
a short time afterward, and, although we
kept a bright lookout for him, not a thing
did we see of him. Whatever became of him
I don’t know.</p>

<p>“Well, Carlos, so-long,” said Bill, when
Henderson had ridden away out of hearing.
“I hope you will reach the States in safety.
Put it there.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to leave me here?” said I,
overjoyed.</p>

<p>“Yes, I reckon we might as well. What
do you say, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Let the kid go. He’s a brave lad,”
returned Jack.</p>

<p>“Now, Bill,” said I, as I took the outlaw’s
hand in mine, “I want to say something,
if I thought you would not take it
to heart.”</p>

<p>“No preaching, now!” said Bill, with a
laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[345]</span></p>

<p>“No, I won’t preach. Why do you do
this?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s preaching, and I didn’t agree
to answer every one of your questions.”</p>

<p>“You see something about me that reminds
you of days when you did not do this way,”
said I. “That person don’t know where you
are, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s neither here nor there,” said Bill
impatiently. “So-long, Carlos. Come on,
Jack.”</p>

<p>Jack reached down from his saddle in order
to give me a good shake, and then clattered
off up the prairie after Bill. I stood and
watched them for a long time, but neither of
them looked around, and finally the nearest
swell hid them from sight. There was something
good about that man, and I never heard
of him afterward. Probably he lost his life
in some of his numerous raiding expeditions.
But there was one thing about it: He left
one boy behind who was sorry for him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">When Coyote Bill and Jack had disappeared,
and a glance in the direction
Henderson had gone showed me that he also
had vanished, I began to think about myself.
I was alone on the prairie, but I didn’t care
for that as much as I did for the safety of Bob
Davenport and the men who had gone away
with him. I staked out my horse, and while I
was thinking about it, it occurred to me that
now was the time to find Henderson’s revolver.
I had taken particular notice of where it fell;
and after half an hour’s looking I had the satisfaction
of securing the weapon which had so
nearly been the cause of my death. It was
silver-mounted, of forty-five calibre, just big
enough to take the cartridges intended for his
rifle, and on the trigger-guard bore the name
of its luckless owner, Clifford Henderson.</p>

<p>“Good!” said I, taking my steps back<span class="pagenum">[347]</span>
toward the ranch. “As often as I look at
it I shall remember him, and if Bob doesn’t
want it, I will always keep it. Let’s see what
effect this bullet would have had upon me.”</p>

<p>Sitting on a tree close by was a robin&mdash;I
knew that the weather was getting cold up
North, for the birds had already come down
to us&mdash;and I tried the bullet on the robin
from where I stood, and saw him come down
without his head. If Clifford Henderson was
as good a shot as I was, he could not well
have missed me at that distance.</p>

<p>The next thing was to find something to eat,
and then came a pipe, during which I thought
the matter over. There was one thing on
which I had long ago made up my mind, even
before separating from Coyote Bill, and that
was that Bob Davenport should not be permitted
to stay in that ranch any longer than I
could help. Coyote Bill was determined to
have that money or drive him from the country.
I gained this much from the conversation
that Bill had had with some of his men, and
how was I to prevent it? I was going to the
States, and I was resolved that Bob should go<span class="pagenum">[348]</span>
too. I was getting sick and tired of so much
pistol-drawing, I did not want to see any more
of it, and I would get back among civilized men.
There was where I belonged, anyway. And
Tom Mason, he must go along too, and relieve
the suspense which I knew his aged relative
would feel at not hearing from him in so long.
He did not know but Tom was dead, and a
letter would go far to cheer him up. But how
should I go to work upon Bob and Tom and
so get them out on the water, where I could
tell them everything? Well, there was another
day coming, and I would see how it looked
after I had slept on it.</p>

<p>The next day passed and still another, and
in the meantime I employed myself in bringing
order out of the confusion in the ranch
and making it look as though somebody lived
there, and not a sign did I see of the returning
Bob Davenport. I began to think something
had happened to them. I did not dare to go
out to look for them, for I might run across
some men belonging to Coyote Bill’s band,
who wouldn’t treat me half as well as their
leader did, so I thought I had best stay right<span class="pagenum">[349]</span>
where I was. On the evening of the sixth
day, when I had got so worked up that I
didn’t think I could stand it any longer, I was
startled out of a year’s growth by seeing a
body of horsemen approaching the ranch.</p>

<p>“Is that Henderson?” I exclaimed, feeling
the cold chills creep all over me. “If it is,
he has brought men enough with him to complete
his work. I will give them as good as I
have got.”</p>

<p>I rushed into the house, and when I came
out my rifle was in my hands and my revolvers
strapped around my waist. The horsemen
had by this time approached near the
ranch, and I could make out that one of them
was Bob Davenport. How I cheered and
yelled at them! An answering yell came in
response, and in a few minutes I was shaking
my friends by the hand. I never hoped to see
them looking so well; there wasn’t one of
them that had been hurt. To repeat the questions
that were propounded to me were impossible,
but in a few minutes I gave them to understand
that I had escaped from the enemy
all right, that I had seen the place where Sam<span class="pagenum">[350]</span>
Noble had been knocked in the head, and that
I had stayed around outside the ranch for
two days before I mustered up courage
enough to return to it. Oh, what a lie that
was! But it served my purpose very well,
and besides I told Bill that I wouldn’t repeat
what he said about Bob, where it would do him
any harm. When I got him away I could tell
him my story. Did I do wrong in keeping
the promise I made to an outlaw? Remember
he was the man who had placed me where I
was that day. If that man had withdrawn
his protection from me I would have died an
agonizing death.</p>

<p>“Well, you have had a time of it!” said
Bob, who pulled up a chair and seated himself
beside me. “We have been to Austin twice,
and Tom got a letter off to his uncle.”</p>

<p>“Good enough!” said I, feeling that a big
load had been removed from my shoulders.
“Tom, you and I will go to the States
together.”</p>

<p>“Are you going, too?” exclaimed Bob.
“Well, I am going, and that will make three.
Elam, here, thinks he can’t go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[351]</span></p>

<p>In fact I hadn’t looked toward Elam, but I
looked at him now, and his face was as long
as you please. He didn’t like it when his
friends were talking of going away and
leaving him.</p>

<p>“And that isn’t all,” continued Bob.
“You know that those soldiers who came by
here before you left told us that the savages
had made an attack on the paymaster, and
made an attempt to secure the thirty-five
thousand dollars which he was taking to pay
off the garrison at Fort Worth. They tried
to shoot the mules, and they got all of them
except one, and he ran most all the way to
Austin.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t they catch him?” I asked; and
I felt that I was going to hear something
thrilling. Bill’s men had spoken of this a
time or two, and predicted that Tom’s luck
would stand him well in hand if he was disposed
to look for this mule, too, but somehow
I didn’t pay much attention to them;
but now I knew that Tom had had a finger
in this also. That fellow just beat the world
for finding things!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[352]</span></p>

<p>“Has Tom found it?” I continued, so
amazed that I could hardly speak.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! Tom has found it,” said Bob.
“We heard about it when we were in Austin,
but we had so many other things to think
of that we hardly thought of it again; but
on our way home we ran across the mule in a
little grove of post-oaks.”</p>

<p>“Dead, was he?”</p>

<p>“As dead as a door-nail. But we found
the specie all right, and we took it back to
Austin, and gave it to a paymaster there.
You see the paymaster that had charge of
the money was killed in the fight. We told
him that we wanted a thousand dollars for
giving it up, and he said he would write on
to Washington and see what they said
about it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want anything for it,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s what he tried to say when he was
in the presence of the paymaster,” said Bob.
“The United States is worth more than he
is, and I resolved that he should have that
amount of money. That was fair, wasn’t it?
We’ll stop and get it when we go back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[353]</span></p>

<p>“Of course it was. But, Bob, what put it
into your head to go up to the States?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think I will be safer there than I
will anywhere else,” said Bob. “Those fellows
were after my money, I can see that
plainly enough, and I will take it and put it
in some bank out of their reach. Perhaps
then they will let me alone. I have given all
my cattle to Lem and Frank to keep for me
until I come back. You don’t see many cattle
around here, do you?”</p>

<p>I confessed that I had not seen a head of
stock since I came to the ranch, and that was
six days ago. But I knew where they were.
Those that had escaped the clutches of the
savages were mixed up with Mr. Chisholm’s
cattle, and it would be a week’s job to get
them out.</p>

<p>“I am glad you have decided to go, and
I didn’t know how I was going to talk
it into you,” said I. “You will have to
see Mr. Chisholm first. He is your guardian,
you know. But what are you going
to do with Elam? He must be provided
for.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[354]</span></p>

<p>“He has hired him out to Lem and me,”
said Frank.</p>

<p>I looked at Elam, and he didn’t seem to be
at all satisfied with the change. He sat with
his elbows resting on his knees and his eyes
fastened on the floor. Bob got up, moved his
chair close to his side, and threw his arm over
Elam’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“If this doesn’t suit you, say the word, and
you will go North with me,” said he. “Our
people up there will be glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t do it,” said Elam. “I’d see
so many broadcloth fellers up there that I’d
want to get away an’ hide in a belt of post-oaks.
I don’t belong up there, anyway.”</p>

<p>“But, Elam, I am coming back.”</p>

<p>“Well, when you come back, I’ll talk to
you. Now, go away an’ let me alone. I can
bear it best by myself.”</p>

<p>To make a long story short&mdash;for we lost no
time in getting out of Texas&mdash;we made up our
minds to start for Mr. Chisholm’s bright and
early the next morning. It would take us
two days to get there. Bob had all my
money, as well as the funds belonging to the<span class="pagenum">[355]</span>
cowboys, and we knew that they were safe.
I said nothing about my coming back to
search for the hidden valuables in the hope of
turning them over to Coyote Bill, or about
Henderson’s attempts to draw a revolver on
me, for that was a part of Bill’s plan to aid
me in my escape; and, besides, that was a
secret that was locked in my own breast until
we got to sea.</p>

<p>“Poor Sam won’t want his money any
more,” said I. “I saw the place where he lost
his life. But the other two cowboys I didn’t
see. I hope they are at Mr. Chisholm’s.”</p>

<p>I never slept so well in that ranch as I did
that night, for I looked upon it as a little
short of a miracle that my party had all come
back to me. They had travelled all the way
to Austin twice, and had never seen an Indian.
That was better than I did, for I wanted to
tell of the scenes I had witnessed in that
camp, but there was no need of it. When
morning came, and we started on our way, I
kept a close watch of the prairie almost in
fear of seeing some of Bill’s band, but they
had taken their eight hundred cattle away to<span class="pagenum">[356]</span>
be slaughtered, and I never saw them again.
Eight hundred cattle, did I say? I believed
they had more than that. By separating his
band after the attack on the paymaster was
made, the chief had been able to attack half a
dozen ranches almost at the same moment,
and got away with some cattle at each place.
I thought that eight thousand head of stock
would more nearly fill his bill. In due time
we pulled up at Mr. Chisholm’s ranch just at
supper time, and there I saw something that
made me feel good&mdash;a couple of fellows sitting
in chairs, who were evidently too badly hurt
to move about. The one had an arrow
through his foot, the other had something the
matter with his arm; but the way they greeted
us proved that there was nothing the trouble
with their lungs. They were the two cowboys
who had been out with Sam Noble herding
stock. But they had not seen me when I was
captured, they were miles away by that time,
and so I breathed easy.</p>

<p>“Well, by gum! if you fellows aint here
yet,” said Mr. Chisholm. “Where did you
leave the Indians?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[357]</span></p>

<p>“Didn’t see any while we were gone,” said
Bob, who ran up the stairs to the porch and
fairly hugged the wounded cowboys. “How
do you do, anyway? You have seen some
Indians, haven’t you? How did you boys
manage to escape?”</p>

<p>It was a story that was soon told. The Indians
got after them down at the gully&mdash;how
well I remembered where it was!&mdash;and killed
Sam and his horse dead at the first fire. The
others threw themselves behind their horses,
Indian fashion, and got safely off, if we except
the two arrows that went through them.</p>

<p>“But my money is what troubles me,” said
the one who did the talking. “My money is
what bothers me, dog-gone ’em! They went
to our ranch an’ got everything we had.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked Bob. “I
slept at the ranch last night, and found something.”</p>

<p>“I guess you dug it up before you went
away, didn’t you?” said the cowboy, who
was overjoyed to hear that his money was
safe. “I can rest easy now. That’s what
comes of having a friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[358]</span></p>

<p>That night, after supper, the money which
Bob had taken the precaution to carry with
him, when running from the Indians, was
again paid out to the men with the exception
of the thousand dollars due Sam Noble. This
was paid to Mr. Chisholm in the hope that
some of his heirs might claim it, when it was
to be given to them. Then our errand was
broached&mdash;that we were going to the States&mdash;and
it threw a damper on all of them, all
except Mr. Chisholm. He had been thinking
about it ever since the attack was made upon
the paymaster, and to our surprise and
delight he said:</p>

<p>“Boys, it is the best thing you can do, and
the sooner you get about it the better you will
suit me. If you were my own boys who were
going off I couldn’t feel worse about it. But
you don’t say anything about Elam.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t want to go,” said Bob. “But
we are coming back here again, or at least to
Denver, and if he will buy some cattle and get
back there by next summer, we will see him.”</p>

<p>“I can’t go,” said Elam. “I don’t belong
in that country anyway.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[359]</span></p>

<p>The next thing was to arrange it so that
Elam could work for some of the cowboys during
the winter, and so be on hand to buy the
cattle when spring opened up. Finding the
two wounded cowboys there with Mr. Chisholm
slightly interfered with our plans, for
now we were compelled to divide the stock
into four instead of two equal parts; but the
cowboys were all in favor of it, and each one
agreed to take Elam as long as he was willing
to stay with them. But Elam was already
satisfied with the arrangements he had made
with Lem and Frank, and concluded he would
stay with them. When he made this decision
he got up and went out of doors. I could
see that Bob didn’t like it a bit. He wished
he could prevail upon Elam to go North with
him.</p>

<p>“It isn’t any use,” said Mr. Chisholm.
“He belongs down here, and here he is going
to stay. Now let’s go to bed, all of us. In
the morning I will have you up at the first
peep of day.”</p>

<p>The next morning we ate breakfast by the
aid of the light thrown out by the camp fire<span class="pagenum">[360]</span>
on the hearth, and before we were fairly
done we received the order “catch up.” I
tell you it was hard work to part from those
wounded cowboys, for we had known them
longer than we had anybody else. The one
who had the arrow through his arm insisted
that he would go to Austin with us, but Mr.
Chisholm, like Uncle Ezra in a similar case,
“put his foot down,” and said he should stay
right there on the ranch and never go out of
it until he came back. We waved our hats to
them as long as we remained in sight, and
when the neighboring swells hid them from
view, we felt that we had parted from some
of our best friends. In due time we reached
Austin and put up at the same hotel we
stopped at before, only Lem and Frank didn’t
receive orders to sit on the porch and look out
for Henderson. We all put away our horses
and bent our steps toward the bank. The
cashier was there, and he said Mr. Wallace
was in his private office. He was busy with
his papers,&mdash;in fact he always seemed to be
busy,&mdash;but he laid them down when we came
in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[361]</span></p>

<p>“Hello, Chisholm,” said he. “What’s
up?”</p>

<p>“These boys here have made up their
minds to go to the States, and I want to sign
Bob’s papers,” said he. “Get ’em all out
so’t I can have them off’n my mind.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes! sit down,” said the banker.
“Bob, how are you? You see, you didn’t go
through any forms the last time you were
here, and I must have some now. If this boy
is going to take his money away from me and
deposit it in some Northern bank, I must
have a paper which authorizes me to give up
the money. It was all right before, but it has
got to be changed now,” he added, when he
saw Mr. Chisholm double up his huge fist
and move it up and down over the table.
“Sit down, and I’ll send for a lawyer to come
right here.”</p>

<p>It was all very easy for the banker to say
“sit down,” but Mr. Chisholm preferred to
stand, seeing that none of his men could be
seated at the same time. Mr. Wallace sent
for a lawyer, giving some instructions which I
did not understand, and in a few minutes the<span class="pagenum">[362]</span>
gentleman made his appearance with a roll of
papers in his hand. He received some orders
from Mr. Wallace, and in less time than it
takes to tell it the document was ready for
his signature. Mr. Chisholm protested, but
he signed his name, and then the money was
ready for Bob; the banker presenting him
with the box which contained his stocks and
bonds, and with a check drawn on a bank on
New Orleans for the rest of his funds.</p>

<p>“Now, Bob, good-by,” said the banker,
rising to his feet and extending his hand. “I
hope you will get through with your money
safe. Don’t let anybody steal it from you.”</p>

<p>“Steal it?” echoed Bob.</p>

<p>“Certainly. You will find plenty of people
on the road who will gladly relieve you of
that box. Put it in your trunk, and stand
guard over it day and night.”</p>

<p>“By George! I never thought of that,”
said Bob, looking distressed. “Elam, you
come with me. Mr. Chisholm and Tom will
have to go with the rest to call upon that
paymaster.”</p>

<p>Tom Mason knew where to find the paymaster’s<span class="pagenum">[363]</span>
office, and with the distinct understanding
that he was to ask for one
thousand dollars for returning that money,
we left the banker, and Bob pursued his way
to his hotel. We found the paymaster there,
and he recognized Tom the moment he
came in.</p>

<p>“You’re back already, aint you?” said he.
“Well, I haven’t heard from Washington
yet, but I tell you plainly that I don’t think
you will receive more than one-tenth of the
sum you returned to us. Five hundred
dollars will more than pay you for that.”</p>

<p>“These boys have made up their minds to
go to the States,” said Mr. Chisholm.</p>

<p>“Very well. You have a power of attorney,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t got that,” said Mr. Chisholm,
wondering what new “form” he would
have to go through.</p>

<p>“You will have to go to an attorney to get
it,” said the paymaster. “Of course, if he is
going away, I shall have to have authority to
pay the money to somebody.”</p>

<p>“By gum! Bring on the paper,” said Mr.<span class="pagenum">[364]</span>
Chisholm, looking around for a chair in which
to seat himself.</p>

<p>“But I haven’t got the paper here. You
will have to go to a lawyer to get it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chisholm slowly went out of the paymaster’s
office, and we all followed him. He
kept on without saying a word, and finally he
stopped in the office of the surrogate&mdash;the
same man who had looked into his pistol
when he was here before. In a few words he
made known to him the situation.</p>

<p>“Why, certainly; you must have a power
of attorney if you want to get the money,”
said the surrogate. “I will make you out
one in five minutes. But, mind you, you
needn’t show it until you see a chance of
getting the money.”</p>

<p>This new “form” was complied with, and
Mr. Chisholm paid the surrogate the sum of
ten dollars for his paper. In fact, I noticed
that he didn’t charge less than ten dollars for
anything. On the way back to the hotel Tom
offered him the money, but Mr. Chisholm
waved it aside.</p>

<p>“I am willing to pay ten dollars to have my<span class="pagenum">[365]</span>
eyes opened,” said he. “If anybody ever
gets me to sign any papers again, I want to
know it. I am done probating wills.”</p>

<p>Bob was considerably disappointed when he
found that Tom wasn’t going to get his
money, but of course he saw that it was all
right. The next day we spent in buying
clothes, and devoted the next to the purchase
of souvenirs to remind Tom of his cattle life
in Texas. On the next day Tom’s letter came.
Some parts of it were brief and to the point,
and ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You had better come home now, and forget all about
that five thousand dollars. You didn’t take it anyway,
and why should the matter be laid to you? Your uncle
walks with a cane, and was so excited over your letter
that he brought it to me to reply to it. Come home and
see him at any rate.</p></div>

<p>Tom Mason was in dead earnest to go home
after receiving that letter. He never expected
to receive a letter like that from Joe Coleman,
but then Joe wasn’t down on him any more
than the rest of “Our Fellows” were. The
very next day we brought our trunks down,
all ready to take the stage to Houston by way<span class="pagenum">[366]</span>
of Clinton, six miles from the sea. Mr. Chisholm
was there as well as the cowboys, but I
couldn’t see anything of Elam. I had already
given him my horse, and the way he received
it told me that he considered that a good-by.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, if I don’t see you again,
hallo,” said Mr. Chisholm, hastily drawing
his hand across his eyes. “You are going
far away, and there’s no knowing what will
happen to you. So-long.”</p>

<p>We got aboard, the driver cracked his whip,
and we were whirled away from some of the
best friends a man ever had. Bob was very
lonely after that, and it was only when he
reached Clinton and saw the steamer that was
to carry him across the Gulf to New Orleans,
that he recovered his usual spirits. Tom
Mason now assumed charge&mdash;he was more at
home in that line of business than we were&mdash;and
in less than half an hour after we reached
Clinton we were aboard the ship, our passage
paid, and we were sitting on the deck watching
the stevedores at their labor. This I
thought to be a good time for my story, and
I brought out the revolver with Clifford<span class="pagenum">[367]</span>
Henderson’s name on the trigger guard, and
for an hour those fellows scarcely interrupted
me. They listened spellbound. When I was
through they drew a long breath of relief.</p>

<p>“You have kept your word, if it was made
to an outlaw,” said Bob. “Now, what do
you suppose his object was? He has always
seen something about you that took his eye.”</p>

<p>“I am as much in the dark as you are,”
I replied. “I only know that he saved me
from death.”</p>

<p>For a long time after this Coyote Bill was
our principal subject of conversation, until the
steamer got under way, and then we had other
topics to talk about. In due time we arrived
in New Orleans and there we spent just one
day, in order to deposit our money in the
bank. We did not know how long we should
remain at Tom Mason’s home, and we thought
that would be the best place for it. At
four o’clock we took passage on a steamer
from which we were not to get off until we
reached Tom’s destination. The torches were
lighted when we drew up to the landing, but
we saw there a carriage and an old gray-headed<span class="pagenum">[368]</span>
man leaning on a cane. I knew it was
General Mason before Tom spoke.</p>

<p>“There’s my uncle!” he exclaimed, almost
wild with delight. “My goodness, how he
has changed!”</p>

<p>Tom ran down to the forecastle and cleared
the long jump of ten feet to reach the bank,
and hastened up to where the old man stood.
We turned away, for we did not care to see
that meeting between uncle and nephew, and
when we got our luggage ashore, and the
steamer was backing out to continue her journey
up the river, Tom came down to us. It
was the first time I had seen him cry, but he
blew his nose with a blast like a trumpet.</p>

<p>“These are the boys who stood up for me
when I was friendless and alone,” said he.
“Bob Davenport and Carlos Burnett. I really
wish Elam was here, so that you could shake
him by the hand, for he is the one who took
me up when I was starving.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?” ejaculated the old gentleman,
who tried not to show how delighted he
was. “Go and get him. I want to see him.”</p>

<p>As it was somewhere near a thousand<span class="pagenum">[369]</span>
miles to the place where we had left Elam, we
didn’t say anything about going after him.
We passed it off in some way, and followed
the old man into the carriage. We didn’t go
to sleep at all that night, for the general was
anxious to hear where we had been, and what
we had been doing, since Tom went away.
When day broke I went on the porch and
looked around. There was a splendid plantation;
everything was in apple-pie order, and
a host of servants ready to do his bidding, and
what Tom could make by running away from
a home like that, I didn’t see. I expressed as
much to him when he came out there later.</p>

<p>“Because I was a fool,” said he. “Nobody
could make anything by running away from
a home like this, but I tell you it has opened
my eyes. I feel as if I had got among friends
from whom I have long been separated.”</p>

<p>That day I made the acquaintance of “Our
Fellows,” who rode down to see us, and I tell
you I found them good fellows, every one.
Tom Mason was getting up on a par with
Sandy Todd now, for with this exception he
was head and shoulders above every one of<span class="pagenum">[370]</span>
them. His sleeping in the open air for almost
a year had done wonders for him.</p>

<p>We haven’t been to the plains yet to settle
up with Uncle Ezra and to see Elam, but we
are going as soon as spring opens. After that
Tom will settle down as he used to be before,
only he will have the management of the
plantation. I have been hunting on several
occasions with “Our Fellows,” and if you
could see Tom when he was toasting his shins
in front of our camp-fire and telling his
stories, you would say that none of his adventures
ever had so great an effect on him as
those that befell him in Texas.</p>

<p class="atitle">HORATIO ALGER, JR.</p>

<p>The enormous sales of the books of Horatio Alger, Jr.,
show the greatness of his popularity among the boys, and
prove that he is one of their most favored writers. I am told
that more than half a million copies altogether have been
sold, and that all the large circulating libraries in the country
have several complete sets, of which only two or three volumes
are ever on the shelves at one time. If this is true,
what thousands and thousands of boys have read and are
reading Mr. Alger’s books! His peculiar style of stories,
often imitated but never equaled, have taken a hold upon the
young people, and, despite their similarity, are eagerly read
as soon as they appear.</p>

<p>Mr. Alger became famous with the publication of that
undying book, “Ragged Dick, or Street Life in New York.”
It was his first book for young people, and its success was so
great that he immediately devoted himself to that kind of
writing. It was a new and fertile field for a writer then, and
Mr. Alger’s treatment of it at once caught the fancy of the
boys. “Ragged Dick” first appeared in 1868, and ever since
then it has been selling steadily, until now it is estimated
that about 200,000 copies of the series have been sold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[2]</span></p>

<p>A writer for boys should have an abundant sympathy
with them. He should be able to enter into their plans,
hopes, and aspirations. He should learn to look upon life
as they do. Boys object to be written down to. A boy’s
heart opens to the man or writer who understands him.</p>

<p class="atitle">HARRY CASTLEMON.</p>

<p class="center boldfont">HOW I CAME TO WRITE MY FIRST BOOK.</p>

<p>When I was sixteen years old I belonged to a composition
class. It was our custom to go on the recitation seat
every day with clean slates, and we were allowed ten minutes
to write seventy words on any subject the teacher
thought suited to our capacity. One day he gave out “What
a Man Would See if He Went to Greenland.” My heart was
in the matter, and before the ten minutes were up I had one
side of my slate filled. The teacher listened to the reading
of our compositions, and when they were all over he simply
said: “Some of you will make your living by writing one
of these days.” That gave me something to ponder upon.
I did not say so out loud, but I knew that my composition
was as good as the best of them. By the way, there was
another thing that came in my way just then. I was reading
at that time one of Mayne Reid’s works which I had
drawn from the library, and I pondered upon it as much as
I did upon what the teacher said to me. In introducing
Swartboy to his readers he made use of this expression:
“No visible change was observable in Swartboy’s countenance.”
Now, it occurred to me that if a man of his education
could make such a blunder as that and still write a
book, I ought to be able to do it, too. I went home that very
day and began a story, “The Old Guide’s Narrative,” which
was sent to the <cite>New York Weekly</cite>, and came back, respectfully
declined. It was written on both sides of the sheets
but I didn’t know that this was against the rules. Nothing
abashed, I began another, and receiving some instruction,
from a friend of mine who was a clerk in a book store, I
wrote it on only one side of the paper. But mind you, he
didn’t know what I was doing. Nobody knew it; but one<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
day, after a hard Saturday’s work&mdash;the other boys had been
out skating on the brick-pond&mdash;I shyly broached the subject
to my mother. I felt the need of some sympathy. She
listened in amazement, and then said: “Why, do you think
you could write a book like that?” That settled the matter,
and from that day no one knew what I was up to until I sent
the first four volumes of Gunboat Series to my father. Was
it work? Well, yes; it was hard work, but each week I had
the satisfaction of seeing the manuscript grow until the
“Young Naturalist” was all complete.</p>

<p class="atitle">EDWARD S. ELLIS.</p>

<p>Edward S. Ellis, the popular writer of boys’ books, is
a native of Ohio, where he was born somewhat more than a
half-century ago. His father was a famous hunter and rifle
shot, and it was doubtless his exploits and those of his associates,
with their tales of adventure which gave the son his
taste for the breezy backwoods and for depicting the stirring
life of the early settlers on the frontier.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellis began writing at an early age and his work was
acceptable from the first. His parents removed to New
Jersey while he was a boy and he was graduated from the
State Normal School and became a member of the faculty
while still in his teens. He was afterward principal of the
Trenton High School, a trustee and then superintendent of
schools. By that time his services as a writer had become
so pronounced that he gave his entire attention to literature.
He was an exceptionally successful teacher and wrote a number
of text-books for schools, all of which met with high
favor. For these and his historical productions, Princeton
College conferred upon him the degree of Master of Arts.</p>

<p>The high moral character, the clean, manly tendencies
and the admirable literary style of Mr. Ellis’ stories have
made him as popular on the other side of the Atlantic as in
this country. A leading paper remarked some time since,
that no mother need hesitate to place in the hands of her boy
any book written by Mr. Ellis. They are found in the leading
Sunday-school libraries, where, as may well be believed,
they are in wide demand and do much good by their sound,
wholesome lessons which render them as acceptable to parents
as to their children. All of his books published by Henry
T. Coates &amp; Co. are re-issued in London, and many have
been translated into other languages. Mr. Ellis is a writer
of varied accomplishments, and, in addition to his stories, is
the author of historical works, of a number of pieces of popular<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
music and has made several valuable inventions. Mr.
Ellis is in the prime of his mental and physical powers, and
great as have been the merits of his past achievements, there
is reason to look for more brilliant productions from his pen
in the near future.</p>

<p class="atitle">J. T. TROWBRIDGE.</p>

<p>Neither as a writer does he stand apart from the great
currents of life and select some exceptional phase or odd
combination of circumstances. He stands on the common
level and appeals to the universal heart, and all that he suggests
or achieves is on the plane and in the line of march of
the great body of humanity.</p>

<p>The Jack Hazard series of stories, published in the late
<cite>Our Young Folks</cite>, and continued in the first volume of <cite>St.
Nicholas</cite>, under the title of “Fast Friends,” is no doubt
destined to hold a high place in this class of literature. The
delight of the boys in them (and of their seniors, too) is
well founded. They go to the right spot every time. Trowbridge
knows the heart of a boy like a book, and the heart
of a man, too, and he has laid them both open in these books
in a most successful manner. Apart from the qualities that
render the series so attractive to all young readers, they
have great value on account of their portraitures of American
country life and character. The drawing is wonderfully
accurate, and as spirited as it is true. The constable, Sellick,
is an original character, and as minor figures where will
we find anything better than Miss Wansey, and Mr. P. Pipkin,
Esq. The picture of Mr. Dink’s school, too, is capital,
and where else in fiction is there a better nick-name than
that the boys gave to poor little Stephen Treadwell, “Step
Hen,” as he himself pronounced his name in an unfortunate
moment when he saw it in print for the first time in his lesson
in school.</p>

<p>On the whole, these books are very satisfactory, and
afford the critical reader the rare pleasure of the works that
are just adequate, that easily fulfill themselves and accomplish
all they set out to do.&mdash;<cite>Scribner’s Monthly.</cite></p>
